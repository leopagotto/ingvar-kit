## 📞 Questions & Next Steps

### For Leo:

1. **Does the pack hunting metaphor feel right?**

   - Hunt cycles instead of sprints?
   - 4 roles instead of generic agents?
   - Pack hunting philosophy inspiring?

2. **Priority for Phase 2?**

   - Should we focus on team setup first?
   - Or hunt cycle automation?
   - Or analytics/metrics?

3. **Package strategy?**

   - Keep as `leo-workflow-kit` v5.0?
   - Or new `@osp-group/lionpack` package?
   - Separate repo or same repo?

4. **Timeline comfortable?**
   - 8-12 weeks for Phase 2-12?
   - Can compress with more resources?
   - Phased releases vs big bang v5.0?

### For the Team:

- Ready to implement Phase 2?
- Want to review technical architecture first?
- Need clarifications on any role descriptions?
- Ready to build the hunt cycle tracker?
