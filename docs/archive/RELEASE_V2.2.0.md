# 🚀 Version 2.2.0 - Automatic Issue Creation via GitHub Copilot

## Date: October 19, 2025

## 🎯 Major Feature Release

### The Problem You Identified

"Let's make sure that the kit creates the issue just when the user asks GitHub... The user doesn't have to write down everything in the terminal - that would be done by Copilot."

### The Solution Implemented

**GitHub Copilot now automatically creates issues when you describe work in conversation!**

---

## ✨ What's New

### 1. Automatic Issue Creation via Copilot 🤖

When you describe work to GitHub Copilot, it automatically creates properly formatted GitHub issues.

#### How It Works

**You say to Copilot:**

- "We need to fix the login button not working on mobile"
- "Let's add dark mode support"
- "The search is too slow, we should optimize it"
- "There's a bug with the payment form"

**Copilot automatically:**

1. ✅ Detects you're describing work to be done
2. ✅ Extracts key information (type, priority, component)
3. ✅ Runs `leo issue` command with smart defaults
4. ✅ Creates issue with proper labels and description
5. ✅ Confirms with issue number and link

**No more:**

- ❌ Manual form filling
- ❌ Interrupting your flow
- ❌ Switching context to terminal
- ❌ Remembering issue template fields

### 2. Enhanced Copilot Instructions 📝

Added comprehensive automatic issue creation section at the top of Copilot instructions (CRITICAL priority):

```markdown
## 🤖 Automatic Issue Creation (CRITICAL)

### When User Describes Work/Tasks/Bugs

**AUTOMATICALLY create GitHub issues without asking the user to fill out forms manually.**

When the user describes:

- "We need to fix [problem]"
- "Let's add [feature]"
- "There's a bug with [component]"
- "Create a task to [action]"
- "We should improve [thing]"

**YOU MUST:**

1. Detect the intent
2. Extract key information (priority, type, component)
3. Use run_in_terminal tool: leo issue
4. Fill prompts automatically based on extracted info
5. Confirm to user with issue number and link
```

### 3. Interactive GitHub Authentication 🔐

Added to `leo init` command:

```bash
🔐 GitHub authentication required for full functionality
This enables automatic issue creation and GitHub API access

? Would you like to authenticate with GitHub now? Yes

🔑 Starting GitHub authentication...

✅ GitHub authentication successful!
```

**Benefits:**

- Guides users to authenticate during setup
- Explains why authentication is needed
- Offers skip option with clear instructions
- Ensures automatic issue creation works

### 4. Package Optimization 📦

**Further improved .npmignore:**

- Excludes all internal documentation
- Excludes .github/ and docs/ directories from package
- Keeps only essential files (README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG)

**Result:**

- Package size: 47.4 KB (still lean!)
- Only 24 files published
- Templates and core functionality intact
