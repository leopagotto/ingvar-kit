cd /tmp/leo-smoke-test-1760814359  # Use the test repo from smoke test
ingvar init

# Select: "Create new GitHub Project"
# Enter name: "Test Project v2.0"
# Enter description: "Testing new project creation"
```

### Test 2: Use Existing Project
```bash
# First create a project
gh project create --title "Test Existing Project"
# Note the number (e.g., #42)

# Then in your test repo
ingvar init
# Select: "Use existing GitHub Project"
# Enter: 42
```

### Test 3: Skip Project (Already Verified ✅)
```bash
ingvar init --skip-project
# This was tested in the smoke test - it works!
```
