# Project Documentation

All project documentation is organized here.

## Structure

- **specs/** - Specification files (planning phase - write detailed specs here)
- **guides/** - User guides and tutorials
- **setup/** - Installation and configuration guides
- **development/** - Development documentation and architecture
- **archive/** - Historical documentation and completed work

## Ingvar workflow

### Phase 1: Specification
Write detailed specification files in `specs/` folder. Include problem statement, solution approach, technical details, and acceptance criteria.

### Phase 2: Execution
Convert approved specs into GitHub issues. Track all work in GitHub Projects. Reference issues in all commits.

**Remember: Specifications are FILES. Tasks are GITHUB ISSUES.**

## Contributing

Keep documentation up to date as the project evolves.
