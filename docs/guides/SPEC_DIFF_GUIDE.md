## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Version Range Comparison

Compare specific version range instead of all versions:

```bash
ingvar spec-diff <issue-number> --from <version> --to <version>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Compare v1 to v3
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 1 --to 3

# Compare latest 2 versions
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 4 --to 5

# From v2 to latest
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 2
```

**Use Cases:**

- Focus on recent changes only
- Compare original spec to current state
- Review changes during specific sprint
- Skip irrelevant intermediate versions

### Section-Specific Diff

Focus on changes to a specific section:

```bash
ingvar spec-diff <issue-number> --section <section-name>
```

**Available Sections:**

- `context` - Context section
- `requirements` - Requirements list
- `userStories` - User stories list
- `acceptanceCriteria` - Acceptance criteria list
- `technicalNotes` - Technical notes
- `constraints` - Constraints section
- `outOfScope` - Out of scope section
- `successMetrics` - Success metrics

**Examples:**

```bash
# Only requirements changes
ingvar spec-diff 80 --section requirements

# Only user stories changes
ingvar spec-diff 80 --section userStories

# Only acceptance criteria changes
ingvar spec-diff 80 --section acceptanceCriteria
```

**Use Cases:**

- Product managers reviewing requirement changes
- Developers focusing on acceptance criteria
- QA checking test requirements
- Tech leads reviewing constraints

### Text Length Control

Control how much text is shown for long changes:

```bash
ingvar spec-diff <issue-number> --max-length <characters>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Show only 50 characters
ingvar spec-diff 80 --max-length 50

# Show full text (500 characters)
ingvar spec-diff 80 --max-length 500
```

**Default:** 100 characters

---

## 🔄 Combining Options

You can combine multiple options for precise queries:

```bash
# Recent requirements changes only
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 3 --section requirements

# Summary for specific version range
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 1 --to 3 --summary

# Timeline for recent versions
ingvar spec-diff 80 --from 4 --timeline

# Detailed diff with longer text
ingvar spec-diff 80 --section context --max-length 200
```

---

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Color Coding

- **🟢 Green (+)** - Items added in this version
- **🔴 Red (-)** - Items removed in this version
- **🟡 Yellow (━━━)** - Version separator
- **⚪ Gray** - Metadata (timestamp, author)

### Change Types

**List Changes** (Requirements, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria):

```
Requirements:
  + New requirement added
  - Old requirement removed
```

**Text Changes** (Context, Technical Notes):

```
Context:
  - Old context description
  + New context description
```

### Version Numbers

- Version 1 = Original spec (when created)
- Version 2+ = Each edit to the issue body
- Versions are sequential and never skip

---

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### 1. Product Manager - Track Requirement Changes

**Scenario:** You need to understand how requirements evolved during discovery.

```bash
# View all requirement changes
ingvar spec-diff 42 --section requirements

# Summary of how much changed
ingvar spec-diff 42 --summary
```

### 2. Developer - Review Acceptance Criteria Updates

**Scenario:** QA updated acceptance criteria, you need to see what changed.

```bash
# See only acceptance criteria changes
ingvar spec-diff 42 --section acceptanceCriteria

# Compare before/after specific edit
ingvar spec-diff 42 --from 2 --to 3 --section acceptanceCriteria
```

### 3. Team Lead - Sprint Review

**Scenario:** Review all changes made during the sprint.

```bash
# Timeline of edits
ingvar spec-diff 42 --timeline

# Summary statistics
ingvar spec-diff 42 --summary

# Detailed diff
ingvar spec-diff 42
```

### 4. QA - Verify Test Coverage

**Scenario:** Ensure tests cover all requirement changes.

```bash
# See what requirements were added
ingvar spec-diff 42 --section requirements

# Check user stories evolution
ingvar spec-diff 42 --section userStories
```

### 5. Stakeholder - Audit Trail

**Scenario:** External audit requires change history.

```bash
# Complete timeline with authors
ingvar spec-diff 42 --timeline

# Statistical summary
ingvar spec-diff 42 --summary

# Full diff for documentation
ingvar spec-diff 42 > spec-42-evolution.txt
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No edits found for this spec"

**Cause:** The spec issue body has never been edited.

**Solution:** Edits to issue comments don't count - only edits to the main issue body are tracked.

### "Spec has not been edited yet (only 1 version exists)"

**Cause:** The spec was created but never modified.

**Solution:** This is normal for new specs. Edit the issue body to create version 2.

### Unexpected Changes Shown

**Cause:** GitHub's timeline API includes all body edits, including formatting changes.

**Solution:** Be mindful that even minor edits (typos, formatting) create new versions.

### Missing Versions

**Cause:** GitHub API may not return all timeline events immediately.

**Solution:** Wait a few seconds after editing, then re-run the diff command.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Edit Mindfully**

Each edit creates a new version. Group related changes into a single edit when possible.

### 2. **Use Section Diff for Reviews**

When reviewing with team, focus on specific sections to avoid noise.

### 3. **Document Major Changes**

Add a comment explaining why major requirements changed.

### 4. **Regular Timeline Reviews**

During sprint reviews, show the timeline to highlight iteration.

### 5. **Export for Documentation**

Save diff output to files for compliance or documentation:

```bash
ingvar spec-diff 42 > docs/spec-42-evolution.md
```

### 6. **Combine with Git**

Track spec evolution alongside code changes in your repository.
