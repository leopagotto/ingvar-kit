It is a consistently\nPatterns v . . . . .\navailable user interface element that contains functionality for the\nSubsystems ~ current product as well as for the entire system. It is the foundation\nOverview for navigating and orienting your user to the Ul.

Product name: This is the application's name. It should always and only link the user\nto the product's home page.\n2. Header links: Also known as tabs, these are supported only for internal product\nnavigation. These links should not open a new tab or link to an external place.\n3. Utilities: The Header provides a home for global system-level utilities from anywhere\non the site. Utility icons should not be used to directly navigate to an area. Instead, they\nshould open a panel that provides access to other areas of the product.\n4. Profile access: The Avatar can be a text, two capital letters corresponding to the\ninitials of the co-worker or an image. It provides access to a side panel with the Profile\ncomponent and its details.\n5. App Switcher icon: A way to navigate easily between products and systems.\nRecommended uses for this component include recently used apps, frequently used\napps, or all apps attached to the user's account. If the list has a manageable size,\ninclude all apps or products available on the system.\nResponsive layout\nThe Ingka Co-worker Design Subsystem uses spacing, grids and breakpoints standards\nfrom Skapa. Please read here if you are looking for general information about them.\nLarge breakpoints\nThe Header is configurable to allow a product or platform to choose a configuration\nthat matches its information architecture. You can choose between a header with links\nor a vertical menu/hamburger menu that opens a side panel. The Header is globally\npersistent and will always be in view as the user navigates around the application.\nHeader Nav menu\n=\n0 ———\n0 ———\n0 ———\n0 —\n0 —\n0 ——\n0 ———\nSmall and medium breakpoints\nIn specific use cases for small and medium breakpoints, there is also an option of using\na Bottom Bar Navigation. A Bottom Bar Navigation is a user interface element typically\nused in mobile apps to display navigational options. It appears at the bottom of the\nscreen and can contain icons with labels. The Bottom Bar allows users to quickly switch\nbetween different areas of the application and perform common actions.\nNav menu Bottom Bar Navigation\n- =o\n0 ————\n0 ————\n0 ————\n0 ——\n0 ————\n0 ————\n0 ————\nVariants\nHeader only\nThe Header can be used as standalone navigation for your Ul\nwhen a product has a small number of main sections.

This configuration gives more horizontal space\nfor the page's content, but has limited room for navigation items\n(————— 0 :\nin the header.\nNarrow header\nCurrently we have two variants of the content header. The regular\nfull width and also the narrow content version. NarrowContent\nlimits the max width of the content of the header as well as the\ncontent of the application body.\ncco\nHeader with nav menu\nThe left panel allows for more navigational items to stack\nvertically. This configuration gives more efficient navigation for\nlong menus and provides a clearer hierarchy. This option can\no easily improve the application's user experience and help your\n® cm users find information more easily.\n0 emus\n0 emus\n0 commu\n0 ems\n0 commun\nProduct name size\nThere are two sizes for Product name: Default and Large. Default\nsize is for the long product names. Large size is for the product\nnames which are very short and need to stand out, e.g Hejl.\nThe main navigation can consist of header links, a Hamburger Menu, or a Bottom Bar.\nTabs are not allowed to overflow, and will automatically convert into a Hamburger Menu\nwhen they reach a size where the content no longer fits.\nFor products that are more mobile-focused, there is the option for a Bottom Bar\nNavigation.

A “Skip to main content”\nbutton appears when a keyboard user first tabs into the page. Links and icons can be\nactivated by Enter. Icons can also be activated by pressing Space.\nIX\nPressing the Tab key reveals a 'Skip to main’ button and then moves between other header elements. The numbers indicate the order of the keyboard interaction.\nLandmarks\nIngka Co-worker Design applies a header landmark around the Global Header. This help\npeople who use assistive technology to make a mental model of a screen's content.\nLabelling\nThe accessibility label for a navigation item is typically the same as the destination\nname. If the Ul text is properly linked, assistive technologies like screen readers will\nread the Ul text first, followed by the role of the component.\nLabel\nHome\nRole\n",
