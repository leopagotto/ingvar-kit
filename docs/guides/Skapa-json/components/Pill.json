They can be horizontally scrollable, and the container width is determined\nby the length of its contents.\nIn this variant, all pills are laid out horizontally, and users can simply scroll through the contents.\nScrolling\nWe use the carousel when pills will align with the edge of the screen, preventing the\nnext pill from being displayed. This helps a user know that the overflow can be scrolled.\nOverflow button\nPill Label Pill Label Pill Label > Pill Label Pill Label Pill Label\nOverflow controls indicates there are other pills to be scrolled when the next pill is not present on the screen.\nFixed-width container\nSecond option is to present the pills on fixed-width containers which wrap pills onto\nnew rows. The container height can be controlled by determining a maximum number\nof visible pills.\nWhen the number of maximum visible pills is set, an overflow button allows users to\nreveal the remaining content. Actions bound to the overflow button can vary.\nOrange Apple Mango Orange Apple Mango\nStrawberry Kiwi Pineapple Strawberry Kiwi Pineapple\nMelon +3more...

Button actions used to submit colour preferences.\nPills as selection\nThis pattern uses pills as an alternative to checkboxes, capturing a user's selections,\nafter which those selections are either saved or submitted using a button. In some\ninstances adding an affordance as a leading or trailing icon can help the user identify\nthat the group is capturing a selection instead of submitting actions.\nSelect your interests\nFunctionality Accessibility\nSimplicity Affordability\nDesign Child-safety\nSustainability Data Privacy\nPet-friendly Small-spaces\nSkip Continue\nPills used as a selection, as part of a quiz.\nPills as input\nThis pattern is most similar to a group of buttons.
