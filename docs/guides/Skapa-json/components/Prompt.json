Prompt with the scrollbar on desktop with a divider enabled.\nAction footer\nThe action footer for Prompt is available in single or double action, stacked or side by\nside. The side-by-side variant is dedicated to large-screen displays where we have more\nspace for the copy to fit. On small screens, we stack the actions instead as the space is\noften limited. The Button size variant also changes at the breakpoint from small (S)\nscreens to medium (M) screens.\nYou can also adjust which Button comes first, primary or secondary, depending on\nyour use case*. Though we would advise keeping the alignment consistent - horizontal\nalignment has the primary Button at the end, whereas vertical alignment has the\nprimary Button at the bottom (unless it is a \"cancel\" action).\n*Does not apply to mobile native variants of the component.

Examples and instructions on how\nto make the backdrop are provided on Skapa Components Modal Figma page. Please\nnote that there are visual differences between platforms on how dark and opaque the\n'dim' appears.\nBehaviours\nModals are fragile compared to a regular page as their temporary nature makes them\neasy to dismiss. For this reason, no modal should ever contain complex or high-stakes\ntasks that could risk users’ information being easily dismissed and lost.\nMore on modal content and behaviours.\nDismissing and completing\nPrompts are primarily dismissed by choosing from the actions provided. However, they\nalso have a close button and are dismissible by tapping the backdrop or pressing Esc\nkey, allowing a cancellation without choosing. The closing X button functions as a\nreassurance - when you use it, you know you are closing the Modal only. You're not\nmaking a choice which will lead to further developments. It can be redundant as one of\nthe action buttons will, in most cases, perform the same action. Including a closing\nbutton ensures the Prompt is accessible and provides an alternative way out. That\ncreates reassurance that you can take a step back if needed.\nx\nThis is taking longer than usual This is taking longer than usual\nWe apologise for the inconvenience.
