If a Tab structure becomes too complex,\nconsider using a standard navigation pattern.\nTabs should not be used to indicate progress.\nTabs vs. Segmented Control\nTabs and Segmented Control are similar components as they enable users to switch\nbetween views or content sections without leaving the page or interface. However, the\ntwo components have some key differences that should determine which component\nyou should use in your context.\nAccount Billing Settings\nUse Tabs for navigating between different sections of information, each with its own Use Segmented Control when you need to switch between related content views\ncontent or functionality. For instance, “Account,” “Billing,” and “Settings” in a (web)app. within a context. For instance, toggling between “Grid view” and “List view.”\nTabs vs. Pills\nUse Tabs when you need to structure and navigate information in a page specific\ncontext, or where it's important for the user to stay on the same page.\nTabs work as page navigation placed at the top of the page or region, which switches\nthe content of an entire page or region beneath it. Pills can be placed wherever on the\npage and do not necessarily switch the content below it. Pills can have other item\nattributes attached to it, such as opening a modal.\nI 1Twvill.\nFilter\nMy Info Payment method\nKitchens Bathrooms Outdoors\nTabs used on profile page where the content are page specific. Pills used to navigate to different pages.\nTabs vs. Accordions\nTabs are generally more navigational than Accordions. Tabs allow the user to see their\ncurrent position amongst the other available options.\nTabs switch the content of an entire region or page. They are useful for organising\nrelated content into distinct views. Accordions generally should only expand a short\ndistance to progressively reveal additional information.\nFor scenarios where there are many tabs or the number of tabs is an unknown quantity,\nan Accordion at full width is a safe bet.
