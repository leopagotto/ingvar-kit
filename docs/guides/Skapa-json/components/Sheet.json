Large Sheet.\nSide Sheet alignment\nSide Sheets can be aligned to either side of the screen. Right Sheets are our typical\nalignment choice, but you may find cases where the alignment should correlate to the\nnatural position of an action.\nx x\nRight Sheet. Left Sheet.\nBottom Sheet\nThe bottom Sheet is reserved for screens below the S breakpoint. It can be set to a full-\nscreen or to hug its content. For mobile native guidelines on bottom Sheets, look here.\nx\nx\nBottom Sheet adjusted to cover the entire screen. Bottom Sheet that adjusts to the content.\nSheet header\nThe title and the back Button are optional, but the Sheet should always have a close\nButton. Sometimes certain flows in sheets require multiple steps - a back Button allows\nthe user to return to a previous stage in such cases. The floating variant is a good\nmatch with content such as images to provide a wider viewport (see Theatre for\nexamples). However, the transparent headers do not support titles. Also, all header\nvariants adjust paddings for the S breakpoint to save space.\nModal Header\n) X\nwith close button\nModal Header with\n) Modal title x\nclose button and a title\nModal Header with close button, .\n) & Modal title X\ntitle and a back arrow\nFloating Modal\nHeader X\nL\nSheet action footer\nThe action footer for Sheet is available in single or double actions, stacked or side-by-\nside. The side-by-side variant is dedicated for implementations on large-screen (M and\nup) viewports with more space for the copy to fit. On the S breakpoint, we stack the\nactions instead as the space there is often more limited; the Button size variant also\nchanges from small to medium.\nThe action footer variants with Buttons aligned to the left or right are reserved for all\nlarge sheets and medium sheets with only one action. Depending on your use case, you\ncan adjust which button comes first, primary or secondary. We would advise keeping\nthe alignment consistent - horizontal alignment has the primary button on the right,\nwhereas vertical alignment has the primary at the bottom (unless it is a \"cancel\" action).\nIf the Sheet contains long content, you can enable an optional Divider to visually\nseparate the content from the actions.\nS breakpoints\nStacked actions\nSingle action\nM = XL breakpoints\nSide-by-side actions\nwith medium sized buttons\nButton label Button label\nSingle action\nwith medium sized buttons\nButton label\nLeft-aligned actions\nwith medium sized buttons\nButton label Button label\nRight-aligned actions\nwith medium sized buttons\nButton label Button label\nLeft or right aligned single action\nwith medium sized buttons\nButton label\nBackdrop\nThe backdrop is not part of the component in Figma, however the coded\nimplementations do include it. Examples and instructions on how to make the backdrop\nare provided on Modal Figma page. Please note that there are visual differences\nbetween platforms on how dark and opaque the 'dim' appears.\nBehaviour\nSheets are fragile in comparison to a regular page as their temporary nature makes\nthem easy to dismiss. For this reason, no Sheet should ever contain complex or high-\nstakes tasks that could risk a user's information being easily dismissed and lost. See the\nModal containers page, sub-section Modal behaviours, for more details.\nThe Sheet is best used for focused tasks, providing additional information, and then\nreturning to the main screen. Sheet Modal provides the space for further details while\nstaying in the context of the overall user flow. Use it when you need to add more\ninformation without disturbing the path your user is on. It's meant for additional\ninformation you can continue without - essential or critical tasks should not be in a\nSheet but in the main flow.\nSide Sheet examples\n- xX\nSustainable beauty from sustainably-sourced solid wood, a durable and\nrenewable material that maintains its genuine character with each passing year.

Any content that keeps the\nusers in a Modal state for a long time runs the risk of distancing them from their\ncurrent workflow. This often leads to confusion about where they are, as Modal content\nis isolated from an application's familiar navigation elements.\nContent that's suitable:\nShort, contained tasks. Tasks that have a direct effect to the content below, which can\nbe achieved in a few small, simple steps.\nAdditional information. Focused display of related information that may have been\ncumbersome to include inline on the page below.\nContent to avoid:\nTasks with long, complex or high stake flows.\nThe temporary nature of Modals means that they can be dismissed easily, either\nthrough the Esc key, or the browser back button. In most cases, any input or progress a\nuser has made in the Modal will also be lost. Data loss through Modal dismissal should\nbe low-risk and low-effort to replicate.\nRich content with deep information structures.\nThese often require their own navigation framework, as it may lead the user too far\ndown a rabbit hole from which they may not be able to find their way back. Modal\ncontent is typically not part of the root application information architecture.\nContent that is intended to be linked directly to.\nModals are an extension of the information on the page they were launched from and\nshould always require that context to be set first. Direct URLs to Modals may not always\nexist, depending on the platform and implementation.\nX x\nOut of stock at Atlanta, GA Create an IKEA Family\nSorry, this product is out of stock Profile\nI Yes, | want to join IKEA Family to enjoy\nSee if it's available at another IKEA store discounts, perks and many other surprises\n( ovscomermansiorss) just for IKEA Family members!\nNo, | just want to create a profile and not\nreceive any extra benefits.\nGet notified when it's back in stock\n® By Emall First name\nBy SMS\nEnter your email address Last name\nI have read and understood the IKEA Mobile\nprivacy policy\nL_________________________________________________________________N§a J\n(] Example of a short contained task, which can be achieved in a few small steps.
