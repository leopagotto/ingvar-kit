There should always be a business reason\nSpecial instructions for implementing character counters. For example, delivery\nDeliver between 1 - 5pm only instruction fields where length is a concern.\n28/40\nPrefix\nA prefix can be displayed if it applies to how that data is\npresented in other contexts.

They can be displayed if they\napply to how that data is presented in other contexts. In the\nWidth input, it lets users know that they don’t need to type the suffix\nInput Fields are available in different states to represent the user interaction. The initial\nstate, in most cases, will be the Inactive state. This is the default empty state which\nallows text input.\nThe elements available for each state vary. For example, inactive fields don't have a\ncharacter counter, and helper texts are displayed by default in error and success states.\nLabel Label\nInactive Focused\nLabel Label\n(1) Helper text\nFilled Error Empty\nLabel Label\n(1) Helper text (1) Helper text\nError Filled Error Focused\nLabel Label\nA Helper text A Helper text\nWarning Warning Focused\nLabel Label\no Helper text (] Helper text\nSuccess Success Focused\nLabel\nValue\nDisabled Read-only\nBehaviours\nCharacter counter\nThe character counter displays the character length of the field's\nSpecial instructions value, and the maximum amount of characters that the value can\nDeli bet 1-5 | | have for the field to be submitted.

Take ZIP codes, for example. They will have the same\n11201 length for all users in a given country, so the field for that\n9 g ry\ninformation should have a maximum length to prevent wrong\nvalues from reaching the database. But, since more users are\nalready expecting the limitation, the field won't need a character\ncounter.\nIf needed, annotate these values so they can be applied in\ndevelopment.\nRead-only field\nA read-only field displays a value that is uneditable by the user in\nthe current state, but still able to be interacted with for text\nselection actions.\nLabel If you wish to further emphasise that the field is in a read-only\nYEE state, an option is to enable the leading icon option together\nwith the lock icon.\nLabel\ng value\nMake labels short and clear\nAvoid having unnecessarily long labels, and if the input needs more explanation, use\nthe helper text instead.\nArticle number Article number (eg. 000-000-00)\neg. 000-000-00\nL_____________________________________________________________________‘M§a J\n(] Label is short, and helper text displays more information.

When\nthere's an error present, error messages should stay visible until it's fixed.

Some examples include fields for values in specific currencies, weights,\nand distances in specific units.\nAmount\nUS$ 50\nWeight\n50) lbs\nDecide whether your field is optional or required\nBy default, all fields are treated as required. If a field is inessential yet still needs to be\ndisplayed, it should be labeled accordingly by adding “(optional)” to the end of the label.\nMobile number (optional)\nData format\nIf a user's data should be formatted any particular way, the desired format should be\ndisplayed by the helper text and, if possible, the input should automatically format the\ndata once the user focuses on another field.\nWhile focused, the Input Field should accept data in any format. When unfocused, if the\nformatting is different than expected, the value should be reformatted. When\nreformatting, the input should be as flexible as possible, but if the value cannot fit into\nthe expected format the input should change to an error state. The desired formatting\nneeds to be defined on a case-by-case basis along with the implementation of the\nmethod that will be triggered once the focus moves to another element.\nTo prevent the user from going beyond the formatting constraints the input should also\nhave a character limit, but that limit should take into account the different ways\nsomeone can enter the requested data. For instance, a user could enter a phone\nnumber as “(000) 000-0000\" or “0000000000” and both would be correct, but the first\nmethod has a different amount of characters than the second.\n",
