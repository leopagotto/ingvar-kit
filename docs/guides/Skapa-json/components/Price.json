The rules for Fixed size and\nMixed size apply the same for BT as for the regular price display.\nSubsystems Vv Fixed size\nSupport v\nMixed size\nStrikethrough price\nStrikethrough prices are used alongside an instance of a regular\n(leading) price. They are typically smaller than the leading price\n123 45€ and can be used in the emphasised style for time-restricted offer\n/ prices, or in the subtle style for non-member prices (to indicate\nthe regular price) or a New lower price (to indicate the previous\nprice).\nSubtle Strikethrough Price\n123,45€\nEmphasized Strikethrough Price\nBehaviours\nPrice scaling\nAll elements in the Price component scale in proportion to the\nfont-size of the integer. For the Mixed size Price styling; the\ndecimals, currency symbols and subscript are sized at 50% the\nfont-size of the integer.\nX = integer size\nFor BTI boxes: * The top and bottom padding is 20% the size of\nthe integer font-size. * The left and right padding is 30% the size\nof the integer font-size. « The shadow of the BTI box is 12.5% the\nsize of the integer font-size, with a minimum size of 1px.\nFor (EU) Energy Labels: * The height (in pixels) of the Energy Label\n. (EV) is 150% the size of the integer font-size. Other (legal)\nx*0,2 x*0125 requirements regarding size may apply to other (energy) labels.\nx*0,3 decimal size =x * 0,5\nPrice wrapping\n- Containerwidth ——M Prices expand horizontally. When the component is constrained\nby the width of its container, the text elements in Price will start\nto wrap to new lines. Digits can wrap per character. Words in the\nsubscript wrap by word.\nExamples here are for edge cases where the Price component\nhas both a lot of characters and a subscript.\nBaseline and superscript\nSeveral alignment options are available for the decimal value and\ny 0 0 € currency symbol. This is because some markets have different\nrequirements on how the decimal value and the currency symbol\nshould be displayed. Some markets require both the decimal\nvalue and the currency symbol to be set to the baseline, while\nothers require just the currency symbol to be set to the baseline\n0 0 with the decimal value remaining superscript.\n0 0 TE\n0 0 ,00\n0 0 ,00€\nNegative price\nNegative prices are often used to express discounts applied\nduring checkout or refunds, using the Fixed size Price variant. We\nuse the Unicode \"minus sign\" (U+2212), followed by a Unicode\n\"thin space\" (U+2009) in order to enable screen readers to read\nthe negative price properly.\n—00,00€\nI\nAdding extra space\nWhen extra space between the currency symbol and price is\nrequired, the optional 'Currency Spacing’ property should be set.\nIt uses the \"thin space\" unicode (U+2009).\nSizing prices\nSize prices prominently and proudly. Larger prices form a critical brand identifier for\nIKEA. They are the largest element on the product display next to the image of the\nproduct itself.\nThe font sizes listed under our Price Scale refer to the integer's font size, when Mixed\nsize variant is used the general rule is that the decimal and the currency sign\nare sized at 50% the font size of the integer. (Starting from price-size-500 (24px). Prices\nsmaller than 24px are always the Fixed size variant.)\nImplementation\nPrices are, at minimum, double in size of the product name. In areas where it can be\nimpactful making the price larger than this minimum is encouraged.\nExceptions\nIn certain cases when lack of screen estate is critical, prices are at minimum the same\nsize of the product name.\nLAGOM LAGOM\n79 99¢ 79,99€\nL_______________________________________________________________________N§ J\n(] Product title 16px, Price integer size 36px.
