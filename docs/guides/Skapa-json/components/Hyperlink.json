(1) Avoid placing a hyperlink over an image without a solid background.\nOpening a new tab\nYou shouldn't make links open a new tab unless your user research on your system\nindicates that doing so leads to a better experience. The loss of context from moving to\na new tab can be considered an accessibility issue. While opening a tab on a desktop\nbrowser is usually fairly clear, most of our users are on mobile devices where tabs are\ntypically less visible. Opening a new tab also breaks that tabs back button, which stops\nusers from easily returning to your system.\nForcing a new tab is generally only useful if either the user will need to refer to the\ncontents of that tab to complete a task in the first, or if you want to make sure that a\nuser doesn't leave a flow in the middle. In both situations, you should carefully consider\nwhether there might be an alternative (and more mobile-friendly) approach.\nLinking to external sites\nYou do not need to use an icon to indicate that a link will take a user to a different site.\nUsers often misunderstand these icons to mean “Opens in new tab”, and we do not\nrecommend that behaviour unless your research demonstrates that it will improve the\nuser experience.\nIf it's important that your users are warned about a change in site (or other context, for\nexample a change in language), then this should ideally be written as text. For\naccessibility reasons this notification should form part of the link rather than being\nplaced afterwards.\nMobile native\nProvide adequate clickable area\nIn mobile native design, in most cases, it's recommended to provide a larger clickable\narea than a hyperlink in a body text can offer. You might want to limit the use of\nhyperlinks to a minimum. It's better to propose the associated actions either in a List or\nas Buttons. When the hyperlink is a stand-alone Ul element, use a tertiary button\ninstead.\nHowever, there are cases where it cannot be easily substituted, Terms & Conditions, for\nexample. Skapa provides a hypertext component for such cases (link to Android and iOS\ndocumentation).\nMake your return faster Make your return faster\nLog in to get information about this Log in to get information about this\npurchase as well as your contact purchase as well as your contact\ninformation information\nL_____________________________________________________________________N§ J\n(] Present the associated actions either in a List or as Buttons (1) Avoid using text with Hyperlinks wrapped inside a text block\nAccessibility\nThe component has been validated for accessibility against WCAG 2.2 on June 1'st 2025.\nNotes\n¢ When using the Hyperlink Subtle variant, it's important that it's only used for\nscenarios like headings or when isolated in navigation lists, like footers or menus.
