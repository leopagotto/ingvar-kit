The bars can be plotted vertically or\nhorizontally. Below are some common examples.\nColumn charts\nColumn charts, also known as vertical bar charts, use rectangular bars to represent\ncategories, with the height of each bar proportional to the values being plotted. A\nsimple column chart displays a single data series for straightforward comparisons.\nStacked column charts break down each bar into segments, allowing for comparisons\nof parts within a whole. Clustered column charts group multiple bars together to\ncompare different categories side by side, using colour to distinguish between them.\nSimple Stacked Clustered\nBar charts\nBar charts display data using horizontal bars. The length of each bar represents a value.\nA simple bar chart is used for comparing a single variable across categories, with bars\nof equal width but varying lengths. Clustered bar charts (also known as grouped bar\ncharts) extend this by grouping multiple bars together, allowing for comparisons across\ntwo categorical variables, with colour distinguishing the secondary category.\nSimple Clustered\ne\nLine- and area graphs\nA line graph is commonly used to display change over time as a series of data points\nconnected by straight line segments on two axes. It can be used to show trends,\nillustrate volatility and sudden peaks and valleys. Below are some common examples.\nLine graphs\nLine graphs show trends over time by connecting data points with a line. A simple line\ngraph displays one data set, while a multiple line graph compares two or more data\nsets in the same graph. This makes it easy to see patterns and relationships between\nthem.\nSimple line Multiple lines\nArea graphs\nArea graphs are like line graphs but with the space below the line filled with colour,\nmaking it easier to visualise volume or totals. A simple area graph shows a single data\nset, while a stacked area graph breaks it into parts, helping to see how different\ncategories contribute to the total over time.\nyp\nArea graph Stacked area graph\ne\nPie- and donut charts\nA pie chart can be used when you want to convey the relationship or proportion of parts\nto a whole, and there are few parts you need to highlight. Keep in mind, that it can be\ndifficult to distinguish the different parts of the pie if the sections are similar or there\nare oo many slices. Below are some common examples.\nPie and donut charts are best for comparing a few data points, and especially when the\ndifferences between the data points are significant. A pie chart is a full circle divided\ninto segments, while a donut chart has a gap in the middle, offering slightly different\nvisual characteristics while conveying the same information.\nPie Donut\nProportional area charts\nProportional area charts can be used when comparing size and quantity data. Since it’s\ndifficult to compare object sizes accurately, it is recommended to use proportional area\ncharts for communication purposes rather than analytical. Proportional area charts\nusually use squares or circles. However, any shape can be used, so long as you use the\nshape's area to represent the data. Below are some common examples.\nCircles and squares are commonly used to compare proportions. Nested area charts\narrange these shapes within each other for a more space-efficient layout, making them\nuseful for visualising growth or reduction.\nA\n40% Centex D\n© c\n60% c D\nRect coer B\n©\nCircles Squares Nested\nA gauge chart is often used to display a single metric or data field in a quantitative\ncontext.
