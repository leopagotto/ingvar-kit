This can be\naccomplished in different ways:\nUse helper text to provide specific instructions about a form field\ne If a field needs further explanation on how to be filled out, make use of helper text.\ne If helper text isn't going to be enough, consider redesigning the form, for example by splitting\nup the information into smaller and simpler nuggets.\nUse real-time field validation whenever possible\ne When an input field gets focused out (after being focused on) it should be validated. If it's\nexpecting a numeric entry and it has a string or if it's a required one and it was left blank, always\nshow the component error message. Don't leave all validations until after the submit button is\npressed. If you can prevent an error on submit, do it.\n¢ Only display the success state of a component if it has previously been in an error state, and has\nbeen corrected.\ne For form validation, make sure to scroll the page to the first error on the form and mark all other\nones that have errors.\ne Keep the submit button always enabled because hitting it will force the form validation and can\nshow new errors. Always accept only the first click, as users with motor disabilities might click\nthe button several times unintentionally.\ne Ifa form has an error after submission, the title of the page should get prefixed with “Error:”, for\nexample, “Error: Join IKEA Family”, to better cater to screen reader users.\nFirst name\nLast name\nMobile phone number\ne Avalid mobile phone number is required\nBirthdate\ne Your birthdate is required\nCountry\nTwo examples: A required field error message and a wrong format one.\nProvide useful, friendly error messages\nWhen writing any error messages, consider our voice and tone —the friendly IKEA\ncoworker. This is our close-to-home personification of each of our nine personality\ntraits. They’re someone who knows that the customer wants correct information,\nguidance and can lead them to the right place if they need additional help.\nAn error code can be easy for communicating with customer support but it must be\naccompanied by a comprehensive error message. Users should be able to understand\nwhat happened and if there's something they can do to fix or prevent it from happening\nagain.\nError handling for checkboxes and radio buttons\nOne error message at the end of the group communicates the error state for the entire\ngroup. See more under the corresponding component documentation for the Checkbox\nand Radio Button.\nInform which fields are optional\nSince we aim to ask the minimum amount of information, by default all fields are\ntreated as required. If a field is not essential, and it needs to be displayed, it should be\nlabeled accordingly by having ‘(optional)' added to the end of the label.\nDescription (optional)\nA text area with ‘(optional)' added to the end of the label.\nText input components\nReason for return\nFirst name Some bolts are missing from the\nackage\n° °\n39/200\nInput Text area\nEnables the user to input and edit text.

It's easier for users to\nunderstand related information when they're grouped together on blocks or fieldsets.\nOrder forms logically\nJust as important as grouping related info together, the order of the fields should feel\nintuitive and logical for the user. You will probably never ask for an address ahead of\nname, for example.\nTitle Title\nChoose an option v | | Choose an option v |\nFirst name Address\nLast name Last name\nAddress Mobile phone number\nMobile phone number First name :\n| | | |\neee\niv) Fields in a logical and intuitive order. Like chatting with the user. e Fields in a non-intuitive order.\nAvoid multiple columns\ne If possible, stick to single-column forms. Besides being mobile-friendly from the start, it prevents\nusers from reading in a different order as intended and misinterpreting the form.\ne If creating multiple columns is needed, make sure users can navigate the form in a logical way\nusing the Tab key.\nSpace between components\nComponent spacing is very important to enable users to easily scan information and\ncan also be used to create a sense of a set. It should always be adjusted as a whole, not\nindividually.\nWhen thinking about component states, be mindful about extra information that can be\ndisplayed, such as error messages. Use enough space to make it clear that the error\nmessage or the help message is attached to the field above, not the one beneath it.\nMobile phone number\ne Your mobile phone number is required\ns200\nBirthdate\n@ Your birthdate is required\nAn example of the space-200 (32px) being used on a signup form, being aware of the error messages.\nSignup form\nFirst name\nLast name\nE-mail\nPassword\n(J | have read and understood the Terms and\nConditions and Privacy Policy.\n() Yes, | want to join IKEA Family for free to\nget discounts & benefits\nA Beware of making components with Input Fields that have smaller font size than 16px.\nInputs (text, email, number, etc.), text area and select inputs with values styled to be\nsmaller than 16px size will trigger browser zoom on iOS devices, when focused.\nApple's Data Entry Human Interface Guidelines >\nSalesforce's Lightning Design System >\nNielsen Norman Group's Website Forms Usability >\nForm Design Patterns by Adam Silver >\nUp next\nIKEA loyalty >\nx\n[S)\n©\n2\n3\n©\no\nLL\nfine) © Inter IKEA Systems B.V 1999-2025",
