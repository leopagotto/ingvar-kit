## ðŸŽ¯ Your Questions â†’ Answered

### Q1: "Will the Designer Agent actually build code?"

**Your Question:**

> "So the designer agent will actually build in the code, right? We will copilot will build it"

- Responsive specs
- Accessibility requirements
- State specifications
- Figma links

**Frontend Agent builds:** ACTUAL CODE

- React components (.jsx)
- CSS styling (.css or .module.css)
- Storybook stories
- Component tests

### Q2: "Are the latest updates with agent selection implemented?"

**Answer: YES - Fully Integrated**

- âœ… Added model selection section to orchestrator-main.md
- âœ… Added "AI Model Used" header to ALL agent files

| Question                      | Answer             | Evidence                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Designer builds code?         | NO - creates specs | DESIGNER_AGENT_CLARIFICATION.md      |
| Model selection integrated?   | YES                | orchestrator-main.md + agent headers |
| Models auto-select per agent? | YES                | Model matrix documented              |
| All agents created?           | YES (6 total)      | 3 new + 3 updated                    |
| All committed?                | YES                | 6 commits made                       |

**Bottom Line:** Designer creates SPECS â†’ Frontend builds CODE â†’ All with auto-optimized models â†’ 30-40% faster than code-first approach.

Everything is ready! ðŸš€
