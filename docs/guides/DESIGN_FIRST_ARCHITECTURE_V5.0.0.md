## 📋 What Changed

### Before: Monolithic Instructions

**Problem:**

- Single large instruction files (.github/copilot-instructions.md, .clinerules, .cursorrules)
- All agents in one file
- Hard to update individual agent instructions
- No design-first priority
- Backend/orchestration focused, not product-focused

**Files affected:**

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (936 lines)
- `.clinerules` (1279 lines)
- `.cursorrules` (1231 lines)
- No designer agent

### After: Modular, Design-First Architecture

**Solution:**

- Separate instruction file per agent
- Clear handoff documentation
- Designer-First routing
- Rapid prototyping focus
- Product-driven sequencing

**New structure:**

```
lib/ai-instructions/
├── orchestrator-main.md          ← Main routing (NEW)
├── designer-agent.md             ← NEW AGENT
├── frontend-agent.md
├── backend-agent.md
├── testing-agent.md
├── documentation-agent.md
└── devops-agent.md

docs/guides/
├── design-first-workflow.md      ← NEW GUIDE
└── rapid-prototyping-standards.md ← NEW GUIDE
```

## 🎨 New Designer Agent

### Purpose

The Designer Agent is responsible for **rapid UI/UX prototyping** to enable:

- ✅ Visual feedback to stakeholders in 30 minutes
- ✅ Clear design specifications for Frontend
- ✅ Fast iteration based on feedback
- ✅ Design-system-driven consistency

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Wireframing** - Fast sketches to show layout and hierarchy
2. **Component Design** - Define reusable UI components
3. **Visual Specifications** - Exact color, typography, spacing, state definitions
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first, clearly specified breakpoints
5. **Accessibility Specs** - WCAG AA requirements, keyboard navigation, ARIA
6. **Figma Documentation** - Design tool links, component libraries, specs
7. **Handoff Documents** - Clear specs for Frontend implementation

### Output Examples

- Wireframes (paper/digital sketches)
- Component tree diagrams
- Design specifications (colors, typography, spacing)
- Figma files with design components
- Handoff checklist for Frontend

### Speed Target

- Simple component: 10-15 minutes
- Moderate screen: 30-60 minutes
- Complex feature: 1-2 hours

## 🔄 Design-First Workflow Sequence

### Old Sequence (Backend-Focused)

```
Requirements → Frontend → Backend → Testing → Done
(Or mixed up ordering)
```

### New Sequence (Product-Focused)

```
Requirements → Designer → Frontend → Backend → Testing → Documentation
                ↓
             Approve?  ────→ Deploy
```

**Benefits:**

- Designers show visual progress immediately (30 min vs 3+ hours)
- Stakeholders approve design before coding starts (cheap feedback)
- Frontend knows exactly what to build (fewer questions)
- Backend knows exactly what APIs to create (aligned contracts)
- Testing validates against agreed-upon design

### Workflow Document

See `docs/guides/design-first-workflow.md` for:

- Detailed stage-by-stage process
- Timeline comparisons
- Real-world examples
- Feedback loop strategies

## 📐 Rapid Prototyping Standards

New standards established for faster component development:

### Component Structure

```
src/components/
├── atoms/          (Button, Input, Avatar, Badge)
├── molecules/      (Card, FormGroup, ListItem)
├── organisms/      (Header, Form, Modal)
├── layouts/        (MainLayout, AuthLayout)
└── features/       (Feature-specific components)
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (Button, ProfileCard)
- **Props:** camelCase (onClick, isActive)
- **Files:** Match component name (Button/Button.jsx)

### Design Tokens

- **Colors:** Pre-defined palette with semantics
- **Typography:** 8-step scale with sizes, weights, line-heights
- **Spacing:** 8px base grid for consistency

### Reusable Patterns

- Input component with validation
- Card component for layouts
- List component for data rendering
- Modal component for overlays

### Performance Targets

- Storybook stories for all variants
- Unit tests for logic
- Component memoization where needed
- Accessibility: WCAG AA minimum
- Responsive: Mobile-first approach

See `docs/guides/rapid-prototyping-standards.md` for detailed component patterns.
