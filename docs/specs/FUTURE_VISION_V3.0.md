# 🚀 LEO Workflow Kit - Next Evolution Proposal
## Making Developers' Lives Significantly Better

**Current Version:** 2.1.0  
**Proposed Version:** 3.0.0  
**Focus:** Maximum Developer Productivity & Value

---

## 🎯 Vision

Transform LEO Workflow Kit from a **setup tool** into a **daily companion** that developers use throughout their entire workflow - from coding to deployment.

---

## 💡 Core Problem We're Solving

**Current State:**
- Developers spend 30-40% of their time on non-coding tasks
- Context switching between tools wastes 2-3 hours daily
- Manual processes like writing commit messages, PR descriptions, changelogs
- No visibility into project health and team velocity
- Repetitive git commands and workflows

**Our Solution:**
Make LEO Workflow Kit the **single command center** for all development workflow needs.

## 🌟 High-Impact Features to Add

### 1. 🤖 AI-Powered Smart Commands (HIGHEST IMPACT)

#### `leo commit` - AI Commit Message Generation
```bash
# Current workflow (manual):
git add .
git commit -m "update user profile component"  # Vague, not conventional

# With leo commit (AI-powered):
leo commit
# → Analyzes staged changes
# → Generates: "feat(profile): add avatar upload with image preview
#               
#               - Add file input with drag-and-drop support
#               - Implement image preview before upload
#               - Add validation for file size and type
#               - Update ProfileCard component UI
