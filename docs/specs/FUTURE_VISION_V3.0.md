# 🚀 Ingvar Workflow Kit - Next Evolution Proposal
## Making Developers' Lives Significantly Better

**Current Version:** 2.1.0  
**Proposed Version:** 3.0.0  
**Focus:** Maximum Developer Productivity & Value

---

## 🎯 Vision

Transform Ingvar Workflow Kit from a **setup tool** into a **daily companion** that developers use throughout their entire workflow - from coding to deployment.

---

## 💡 Core Problem We're Solving

**Current State:**
- Developers spend 30-40% of their time on non-coding tasks
- Context switching between tools wastes 2-3 hours daily
- Manual processes like writing commit messages, PR descriptions, changelogs
- No visibility into project health and team velocity
- Repetitive git commands and workflows

**Our Solution:**
Make Ingvar Workflow Kit the **single command center** for all development workflow needs.
