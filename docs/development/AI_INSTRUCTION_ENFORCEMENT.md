# AI Instruction Enforcement Strategy

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Version:** 3.0.3
**Purpose:** Ensure AI assistants ALWAYS follow LEO workflow standards from the first message

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Original Issue:**
AI assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Codeium) were not consistently following LEO workflow standards, particularly:

- Not creating GitHub issues automatically when user described work
- Asking "should I create an issue?" instead of just doing it
- Not checking `.leorc.json` for auto-resolve settings
- Not updating issue status when starting work
- Violating commit message length guidelines

**Root Cause:**
Instructions were treated as "guidelines" rather than "mandatory rules" that must be followed in EVERY interaction.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Prominent Enforcement Headers (ALL AI Adapters)**

Added strong enforcement language at the TOP of every AI instruction file:

#### Copilot Header

```markdown
> **⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE: These instructions are ALWAYS ACTIVE ⚡**
>
> GitHub Copilot MUST follow these rules in EVERY response, starting from the FIRST message:
>
> - **Issue Creation:** When user describes ANY work → Create GitHub issue IMMEDIATELY
> - **No Asking Permission:** NEVER ask "should I create an issue?" - JUST DO IT
> - **Auto-Resolve Check:** Read `.leorc.json` for `auto-resolve` setting before working
> - **Status Updates:** Comment "🚀 Starting work..." when starting
> - **Commit Messages:** Keep under 72 characters, reference issue number
> - **Issue Comments:** Keep under 3-4 lines (200 chars max)
> - **Spec-First:** Create spec file for complex work
>
> **These instructions apply to THIS conversation and EVERY conversation in this repository.**
```

#### Cursor Header

```markdown
> **⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE: These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE ⚡**
>
> Claude in Cursor MUST follow these rules in EVERY response, starting from the FIRST message:
> [Same rules as Copilot]
>
> **These rules apply to THIS Composer session and EVERY session in this repository.**
```

#### Cline Header

```markdown
> **⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE: These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE ⚡**
>
> Claude via Cline MUST follow these rules in EVERY task, starting from the FIRST action:
> [Same rules as Copilot]
>
> **These rules apply to THIS task and EVERY task in this repository.**
```

#### Codeium Header

```markdown
> **⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE: These instructions are ALWAYS ACTIVE ⚡**
>
> Codeium MUST follow these rules in EVERY completion, starting from the FIRST suggestion:
> [Same rules as Copilot]
>
> **These instructions apply to THIS session and EVERY session in this repository.**
```

### 2. **Immediate Action Checklist (Copilot Template)**

Added a checklist at the beginning of the main template:

```markdown
## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (First Message Checklist)

**Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST:**

1. ✅ Check if `.leorc.json` exists and read `auto-resolve` setting
2. ✅ Detect if user is describing work (features, bugs, deployments, docs)
3. ✅ If work described → Create GitHub issue IMMEDIATELY (use `gh issue create`)
4. ✅ Announce issue creation with number and link
5. ✅ If auto-resolve enabled → Proceed with work
6. ✅ If auto-resolve disabled → Wait for user approval

**This applies to THE FIRST MESSAGE and EVERY MESSAGE after.**
```

---

### 3. **Final Reminder Section**

Added a prominent reminder at the END of instructions:

```markdown
## 🚨 FINAL REMINDER: THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE

**This is NOT optional. This is NOT a suggestion. This is MANDATORY.**

Every time you interact with this repository:

1. ✅ FIRST THING: Check if user described work
2. ✅ IF YES: Create GitHub issue IMMEDIATELY with `gh issue create`
3. ✅ NEVER ASK: "Should I create an issue?" - JUST DO IT
4. ✅ CHECK CONFIG: Read `.leorc.json` for `auto-resolve` setting
5. ✅ UPDATE STATUS: Comment and move to "In Progress" when starting
6. ✅ KEEP SHORT: Commits < 72 chars, comments < 3-4 lines

**These rules apply from the FIRST message to the LAST message.**
**No exceptions. No "let me know if you want." Just follow the workflow.**
```

---

### 4. **Enhanced Quick Reference Card**

Updated the Quick Reference to emphasize enforcement:

```markdown
## 📌 Quick Reference Card

**⚡ REMINDER: These are ENFORCED rules, not suggestions. Follow them in EVERY response. ⚡**

### Before Starting Work

1. Analyze complexity: Simple issue or complex spec?
2. Simple work: Create GitHub issue immediately (NO asking!)
3. Complex work: Create spec first, get approval, then create issues
   ...
```

---

## 📊 Enforcement Strategy

### Multi-Layer Approach

**Layer 1: Top Header (Seen First)**

- ⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE warning
- Bullet list of MUST-follow rules
- Clear statement: "EVERY response, starting from FIRST message"

**Layer 2: Immediate Action Checklist (Before Work)**

- Step-by-step checklist
- "Before responding to ANY request"
- Applies to "FIRST MESSAGE and EVERY MESSAGE"

**Layer 3: Throughout Content (Reinforcement)**

- MANDATORY workflow sections
- "NO EXCEPTIONS" language
- ❌ NEVER say these phrases
- ✅ INSTEAD, always say these phrases

**Layer 4: Quick Reference (Reminder)**

- "ENFORCED rules, not suggestions"
- "Follow in EVERY response"
- Prominent placement of key rules

**Layer 5: Final Reminder (Last Thing Seen)**

- "NOT optional, NOT a suggestion, MANDATORY"
- Numbered checklist of required actions
- "No exceptions" statement

---

## 🎯 Key Language Changes

### Before (Weak)

- ❌ "You should create issues"
- ❌ "Consider creating an issue"
- ❌ "It's recommended to..."
- ❌ "Try to follow these guidelines"

### After (Strong)

- ✅ "You MUST create issues IMMEDIATELY"
- ✅ "Create GitHub issue (NO asking!)"
- ✅ "MANDATORY workflow"
- ✅ "NEVER ask permission - JUST DO IT"
- ✅ "This is NOT optional"

---

## 🧠 AI Understanding Techniques

### Repetition

- State rule at beginning (header)
- Reinforce in immediate action checklist
- Repeat in main content sections
- Remind in quick reference
- Final reminder at end

### Emphasis

- **Bold text** for critical actions
- 🚨 Emoji indicators for urgency
- ALL CAPS for "MUST", "NEVER", "ALWAYS"
- ❌ and ✅ for clear do/don't instructions

### Specificity

- Exact commands to run: `gh issue create`
- Exact phrases to use: "Issue #X created"
- Exact phrases to NEVER use: "Should I create an issue?"
- Specific numbers: "< 72 characters", "< 3-4 lines"

### Context Awareness

- "EVERY response" (Copilot)
- "EVERY session" (Cursor)
- "EVERY task" (Cline)
- "EVERY completion" (Codeium)
- "THIS conversation and EVERY conversation"

## 🧪 Testing Enforcement

### How to Verify AI Follows Instructions

**Test 1: First Message**

```
User: "We need to add a dark mode feature"

Expected AI Response:
✅ "Creating issue for dark mode feature..."
✅ [Executes: gh issue create ...]
✅ "Issue #42 created: Add dark mode feature"
✅ [Checks .leorc.json for auto-resolve]
✅ "Proceeding with implementation" OR "Waiting for your review"

❌ NOT: "Should I create an issue for this?"
❌ NOT: "Would you like me to create a GitHub issue?"
```

**Test 2: Auto-Resolve Check**

```
User: "Fix the login button on mobile"

Expected AI Actions:
1. Reads .leorc.json
2. Checks auto-resolve setting
3. Creates issue immediately
4. If auto-resolve=true → Starts work
5. If auto-resolve=false → Waits for approval
```

**Test 3: Status Updates**

```
User: "Let's work on issue #42"

Expected AI Actions:
1. Comments on issue: "🚀 Starting work on this issue..."
2. Updates status to "In Progress" (if project configured)
3. Confirms: "✓ Issue #42 → In Progress"
4. Begins implementation
```

**Test 4: Commit Message Length**

```
Expected AI Commits:
✅ "feat: add dark mode toggle (#42)"  [36 chars]
✅ "fix: resolve mobile button issue (#42)"  [40 chars]

❌ NOT: "feat: add comprehensive dark mode support with theme toggle, color scheme persistence, and automatic system preference detection (#42)"  [138 chars - TOO LONG]
```

   - "MUST" not "should"
   - "IMMEDIATELY" not "as soon as possible"
   - "NEVER" not "try to avoid"

2. **Repeat Critical Rules**

   - State at beginning
   - Reinforce in middle
   - Remind at end

3. **Be Specific**

   - Exact commands
   - Exact phrases
   - Exact numbers

4. **Test Frequently**
   - New project setup
   - First message behavior
   - Issue creation workflow

### For Users

1. **Reload VS Code After Setup**

   - Ensures AI loads new instructions

   - Auto-corrects before responding

2. **Enforcement Metrics**

   - Track how often rules are followed
   - Log when AI asks permission (should be 0)
   - Dashboard for compliance

3. **Dynamic Enforcement Levels**

   - Strict mode: Blocks AI if rules not followed
   - Standard mode: Current behavior
   - Relaxed mode: Suggestions only

4. **AI Self-Reporting**
   - AI states which rules it's following
   - Transparent about actions taken
   - Explains reasoning for each step

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Multi-layer enforcement** - Repetition across file
2. **Strong language** - "MUST" instead of "should"
3. **Visual emphasis** - ⚡, 🚨, ✅, ❌ emoji
4. **Specificity** - Exact commands and phrases
5. **Context-aware** - Different wording per AI

### What Didn't Work (Before)

1. ❌ Passive language - "You should consider..."
2. ❌ Single mention - Only stating rules once
3. ❌ Buried in content - Not prominent enough
4. ❌ Generic wording - Same for all AIs
5. ❌ No final reminder - Instructions ended without reinforcement

---

**Enforcement strategy implemented across all AI assistants:**

- ✅ Prominent headers with ⚡ ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE
- ✅ Immediate action checklist for first message
- ✅ Strengthened language throughout (MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS)
- ✅ Quick reference reminder of enforced rules
- ✅ Final reminder section at end
- ✅ Specific commands and phrases required
- ✅ Repetition of critical rules
- ✅ Visual emphasis with emoji and formatting

**Result:** AI assistants will now follow LEO workflow standards from the FIRST message, automatically creating issues when work is described, checking `.leorc.json` settings, and following all workflow rules without asking permission.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for v3.0.3 release
