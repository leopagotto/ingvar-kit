# v2.3.0 Release Summary - GitHub Projects Integration

**Release Date:** October 19, 2025
**Version:** 2.3.0
**Focus:** Automatic GitHub Projects Integration & Intelligent Status Management

---

## 🎯 What's New

### Automatic GitHub Projects Integration

When Copilot creates an issue from your description, it now:

1. ✅ **Automatically adds the issue to your GitHub Project**
2. ✅ **Sets initial status to "Todo"**
3. ✅ **Updates status as work progresses** (Todo → In Progress → Done)
4. ✅ **Keeps your project board synchronized**

### Smart Status Management

Copilot monitors your work and updates issue status based on clear indicators:

**Todo → In Progress:**

- First commit: `git commit -m "feat: implement feature #42"`
- New branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-42`
- User statement: _"Let's work on issue #42"_

**In Progress → Done:**

- PR merged with: _"Closes #42"_
- Issue closed: `gh issue close 42`
- User statement: _"Issue #42 is complete"_

### Project View Configuration

Projects are configured with essential fields:

- **Status** (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Title**
- **Assignees**
- **Labels**

Board view automatically shows work organized by status.

## 📊 Example Workflow

### Before (v2.2.0)

```
You: "We need to add user authentication"
→ Issue created manually or via Copilot
→ Manual addition to project board
→ Manual status updates as work progresses
```

### After (v2.3.0)

```
You: "We need to add user authentication"
→ ✓ Issue #7 created automatically
→ ✓ Added to GitHub Project (status: Todo)
→ ✓ You start coding and commit
→ ✓ Status automatically updates to "In Progress"
→ ✓ PR merged
→ ✓ Status automatically updates to "Done"
```

**Result:** Complete automation with zero manual project management!

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Work Detection

Copilot monitors:

- Git commits with issue references
- Branch names with issue numbers
- Pull request actions (created, merged)
- User statements about work status
- Issue state changes (opened, closed)

### 2. GraphQL API Integration

- Uses GitHub's powerful Projects V2 API
- Reliable status field updates
- Supports custom field configurations
- Works with any project structure

### 3. Zero Configuration\*

\* If you already have a GitHub Project configured

Just tell Copilot your project number once, and it handles everything:

```bash
# Copilot asks once during setup
"Which project number? (Run: gh project list --owner USERNAME)"
→ You: "Project 4"
→ Copilot: Configured! All future issues will be added to project 4
```

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

New guide: `docs/guides/github-projects-integration.md`

- Complete setup walkthrough
- Manual configuration examples
- Troubleshooting tips
- Best practices
- Quick reference commands

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Issue Creation with Project Addition

```bash
# Copilot automatically runs:
gh issue create \
  --title "feat: Add OAuth2 authentication" \
  --body "..." \
  --label "feature,p1,backend"

# Then adds to project:
gh project item-add 4 --owner leonpagotto --url ISSUE_URL
```

### Status Updates via GraphQL

```bash
# When work starts:
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(
      input: {
        projectId: "PROJECT_ID"
        itemId: "ITEM_ID"
        fieldId: "STATUS_FIELD_ID"
        value: { singleSelectOptionId: "IN_PROGRESS_ID" }
      }
    ) { projectV2Item { id } }
  }'
```

## 🎓 Getting Started

### 1. Update to v2.3.0

```bash
npm install -g leo-workflow-kit@latest
```

### 2. Check Your Projects

```bash
gh project list --owner YOUR_USERNAME
```

### 3. Note Your Project Number

```bash
# Example output:
# NUMBER  TITLE                STATE
# 4       My Project           open    ← Use this number
```

### 4. Use LEO as Normal

```bash
# In your project
leo init

# Just describe work to Copilot:
"We need to fix the mobile navigation bug"

# Copilot will:
# ✓ Create issue #8
# ✓ Add to Project 4
# ✓ Set status: Todo
# ✓ Update status as you work
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Tested with:

- ✅ GitHub Projects v2 (new projects)
- ✅ Multiple status configurations
- ✅ Custom field layouts
- ✅ Various work detection patterns
- ✅ GraphQL mutations
- ✅ Project permissions

Verified:

- ✅ Issues added successfully
- ✅ Status updates reliably
- ✅ Works with existing projects
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Requires GitHub CLI authentication**

   - Solution: `gh auth login --scopes "project,repo"`

2. **Project must exist before use**

   - Solution: Create project first via `gh project create`

3. **Status field must be named "Status"**

   - Solution: Rename field or customize in Copilot instructions

4. **Needs project number for automation**
   - Solution: Note project number from `gh project list`
