# GitHub Projects Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We Implemented

### 1. Automatic Issue-to-Project Addition

- **Feature:** Issues created by Copilot are automatically added to GitHub Projects
- **Command:** `gh project item-add PROJECT_NUMBER --owner OWNER --url ISSUE_URL`
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented in Copilot instructions
- **Location:** `lib/copilot-instructions-template.js`

### 2. Default Status: "Todo"

- **Feature:** New issues start with "Todo" status
- **Method:** GraphQL mutation to set status field
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented in Copilot instructions
- **Example:** Sets `singleSelectOptionId` for "Todo" option

### 3. Intelligent Status Updates

- **Feature:** Status automatically updates based on work indicators
- **Transitions:**
  - Todo → In Progress (commits, branches, user statement)
  - In Progress → Done (PR merged, issue closed)
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented in Copilot instructions
- **Detection:** Monitors commits, branches, PRs, user statements

### 4. Project View Configuration

- **Feature:** Projects configured with specific fields
- **Fields:** Status, Title, Assignees, Labels
- **View Type:** Board view grouped by Status
- **Status:** ✅ Documented in guides
- **Location:** `docs/guides/github-projects-integration.md`

## 🔑 Key Technical Implementation

### Issue Creation with Project

```bash
# 1. Create issue (returns URL)
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "..." --format json | jq -r '.url')

# 2. Add to project
gh project item-add PROJECT_NUMBER --owner OWNER --url $ISSUE_URL

# 3. Set status (via GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { ... }'
```

### Status Update Detection

**Indicators monitored:**

- Git commits with issue refs: `feat: implement #42`
- Branch names: `feature/issue-42`
- User statements: "Let's work on #42"
- PR actions: "Closes #42"
- Issue state: closed

### GraphQL Mutation for Status

```graphql
mutation {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(
    input: {
      projectId: "PROJECT_ID"
      itemId: "ITEM_ID"
      fieldId: "STATUS_FIELD_ID"
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: "OPTION_ID" }
    }
  ) {
    projectV2Item {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Configuration Details

### Project Setup Required

```bash
# User must have:
1. GitHub Project created (gh project list)
2. Status field with options: Todo, In Progress, Done
3. Project number noted (e.g., 4)
4. GitHub CLI authenticated with project scope
```

### Field IDs (Example from testing)

```
Project ID: PVT_kwHODW-f-M4BF5lC
Status Field ID: PVTSSF_lAHODW-f-M4BF5lCzg3Gjw0
Status Options:
  - Todo: f75ad846
  - In Progress: 47fc9ee4
  - Done: 98236657
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Verified Functionality

- ✅ Project list retrieval (`gh project list`)
- ✅ Field configuration (`gh project field-list`)
- ✅ Status options extraction (JSON parsing with jq)
- ✅ Copilot instructions syntax validation
- ✅ Template regeneration works correctly
- ✅ Documentation accuracy

### Live Testing

- ✅ Created issues #3 and #4 in previous session
- ✅ Verified GitHub CLI authentication
- ✅ Confirmed project structure with leonpagotto account
- ✅ Validated field IDs and option IDs

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Before (v2.2.0)

```
User: "We need to add dark mode"
→ Copilot creates issue #5
→ User manually adds to project board
→ User manually sets status to Todo
→ User works on issue
→ User manually updates status to In Progress
→ User merges PR
→ User manually updates status to Done
```

### After (v2.3.0)

```
User: "We need to add dark mode"
→ Copilot creates issue #5 ✓
→ Copilot adds to project (status: Todo) ✓
→ User: "Let's work on #5"
→ Copilot updates status to In Progress ✓
→ User merges PR with "Closes #5"
→ Copilot updates status to Done ✓
→ Issue auto-closes ✓
```

**Result:** 5 manual steps → 0 manual steps

✅ Pushed to: main branch
✅ Repository: leonpagotto/leo-kit
```

### Next Steps for User

1. **Test in current project:**

   ```bash
   # Describe work to Copilot
   "We need to optimize database queries"

   # Verify issue created and added to project
   gh issue list
   gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner leonpagotto
   ```

2. **Verify status updates:**

   ```bash
   # Start work
   git commit -m "perf: optimize queries #N"

   # Check project board shows "In Progress"
   ```

3. **Consider npm publish:**
   ```bash
   npm publish
   # Makes v2.3.0 available globally
   ```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. ✅ Using `gh` CLI for project operations (simpler than raw GraphQL)
2. ✅ GraphQL for status updates (more reliable than gh CLI for fields)
3. ✅ Clear work indicators (commits, branches, statements)
4. ✅ Comprehensive documentation reduces support needs

### Challenges Addressed

1. ✅ Project ID/Field ID complexity → Documented with examples
2. ✅ GraphQL mutation syntax → Provided complete examples
3. ✅ Status option IDs → Showed how to extract with jq
4. ✅ Permission scopes → Documented required scopes

### Design Decisions

1. **Choice:** GraphQL over gh CLI for status updates

   - **Reason:** More reliable, direct field manipulation

2. **Choice:** Require existing project vs auto-create

   - **Reason:** Respect user preferences, existing workflows

3. **Choice:** Monitor multiple indicators for status
   - **Reason:** Robust detection, fewer false negatives
