## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **Interactive Mode Bug:**

   - Commander.js option defaults can be tricky
   - Always test CLI with both default and explicit flags
   - Interactive prompts break automated workflows

2. **Mock Testing:**

   - `execSync` mocking requires careful setup
   - JSON responses must match exact format
   - Consider integration tests over complex unit test mocks

3. **GitHub Issues as Specs:**
   - 5-10x faster than file-based approach
   - Better collaboration (real-time comments)
   - No merge conflicts on specifications
   - Project board integration is seamless

### Process Improvements

1. **E2E Testing First:**

   - Real-world testing caught the interactive mode bug
   - Unit tests alone wouldn't have found it
   - Always test the actual user workflow

2. **Documentation Updates:**

   - Update README during development, not after
   - Keep CHANGELOG current with each feature
   - Version bumps should happen with last commit

3. **Pre-Publish Checklist:**
   - Local installation testing is critical
   - `npm pack` helps catch packaging issues
   - `--dry-run` shows exactly what will publish

## 🚀 What's Next

### Phase 3 Planning (Future Work)

**Potential Features:**

1. Agent Integration - AI agents auto-clarify, plan, extend specs
2. Spec Templates - Pre-built templates for common features
3. Spec Validation - Constitutional rules for spec quality
4. Cross-Spec Dependencies - Link related specs together
5. Spec Metrics Dashboard - Visualize spec health, volatility

### Immediate Follow-Up

1. Monitor npm installation issues (if any)
2. Collect user feedback on Phase 2 features
3. Fix TaskManager mock tests (v5.2.1)
4. Consider integration tests for full workflow
