**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Session Type:** Feature Implementation
**Focus:** Automated Documentation Organization
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## üéØ Session Objectives

Based on feedback from using LEO Kit v5.0.0 in production (LionPack Studio project), implement automated documentation organization to eliminate the 2-hour manual cleanup burden.

**Primary Goal:** Prevent root directory clutter with 45+ markdown files

**Target:** Professional repository structure with automated enforcement

---

## üìã Work Completed

### 1. GitHub Issues Created

Following LEO workflow standards, created issues automatically:

- **Issue #71**: feat: Add automated documentation organization system

  - Priority: P1
  - Status: Phase 1 Implemented ‚úÖ
  - Labels: enhancement, documentation

- **Issue #72**: chore: Organize existing documentation files
  - Priority: P1
  - Status: Completed ‚úÖ (Closed)
  - Labels: documentation

### 2. Documentation Organization

**Moved 40+ files** from root to organized structure:

```
Root Directory (Before): 45+ markdown files üò±
Root Directory (After):  5 essential files ‚ú®

Organized into:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/sessions/2025-10/    (6 session summaries)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/phases/              (1 phase report)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/stories/             (7 story documentation files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/releases/            (15 release/deployment files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/guides/              (11 guides and tutorials)
```

**Files in Root (After Cleanup):**

- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE
- SECURITY.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- INDEX.md (new)

### 3. Created INDEX.md

Comprehensive documentation index with:

- Navigation by category (Sessions, Phases, Stories, Releases, Guides)
- Navigation by topic (Getting Started, API, Architecture)
- Navigation by date
- File placement rules
- Maintenance guidelines

**Location:** `/INDEX.md`
**Lines:** 250+ lines of organized documentation navigation

### 4. Implemented `leo organize-docs` Command

**New CLI Command:** `leo organize-docs`

**Features:**

- Auto-detects file patterns (SESSION*SUMMARY*_, PHASE\__, DAYS\_\*, etc.)
- Creates directory structure automatically
- Validates allowed root files
- Supports `--dry-run` for preview
- Supports `--validate` for checking organization

**Implementation:**

- File: `lib/commands/organize-docs.js`
- Lines: 300+ lines of organization logic
- Patterns: 5 file pattern matchers
- Integration: Added to CLI in `bin/cli.js`

**Usage:**

```bash
# Organize all documentation
leo organize-docs

# Preview what would be moved
leo organize-docs --dry-run

# Validate organization
leo organize-docs --validate
```

### 5. Health Check Integration

**Added Documentation Organization Check** to `leo health`:

- **Category:** Documentation
- **Check Name:** Root Directory Clean
- **Points:** 5 pts (new)
- **Pass Criteria:** Only allowed files in root
- **Fail Action:** Suggests `leo organize-docs`

**Updated Health Score:**

- **Before:** 98/100
- **After:** 103/100 (added 5pts for doc organization)

**Grade:** A (Excellent!)

### 6. Git Commit

**Commit Hash:** `02d6a41`

**Commit Message:**

```
feat(docs): add automated documentation organization (#72)
