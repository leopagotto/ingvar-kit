## Executive Summary

**LionPack** reimagines LEO Workflow Kit as a **team-based development orchestration platform** optimized for small, highly efficient development teams (3-4 people).

### The Problem with Traditional Workflows

- Team members work in isolation
- Unclear handoffs between stages
- Bottlenecks when specialists unavailable
- No tracking of team velocity or role allocation
- Generic AI assistance that doesn't understand team context
- Manual status updates and progress tracking

### The LionPack Solution

Inspired by how lions hunt in coordinated packs, LionPack enables:

✅ **Structured Team Roles** - Each member has clear responsibilities
✅ **Seamless Handoffs** - Work automatically passes to next team member
✅ **Parallel Coordination** - Team hunts together, not sequentially
✅ **Role-Aware AI** - AI instructions tailored to team role
✅ **Automatic Tracking** - Progress visible to entire pack
✅ **Velocity Metrics** - Measure team performance and efficiency
✅ **Pack Hunt Cycles** - Sprint-like cycles optimized for team size

## The LionPack Concept

### 🦁 Core Metaphor: The Hunt

A lion pack coordinates hunting through:

1. **Reconnaissance** - Scout locates prey (Requirements Hunter)
2. **Strategy** - Pack plans approach (Spec Refiner)
3. **Attack** - Execute coordinated strike (Implementation Hunter)
4. **Verification** - Confirm success (QA/Testing)
5. **Rest & Repeat** - Hunt cycle completes, new hunt begins

**LionPack applies this to software development.**

### Pack Sizes

**🦁 Solo Lion** (1 person)

- Uses LionPack for personal workflow automation
- Single role: Full-Stack Developer
- Lightweight team features disabled

**🦁🦁 Pair** (2 people)

- Typical: Requirements/Specs + Implementation & Testing
- Flexible role swapping
- Simplified workflow

**🦁🦁🦁 Small Pack** (3 people) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

- Role 1: Requirements & Analysis
- Role 2: Spec Refinement & Issue Preparation
- Role 3: Implementation & Testing
- Optimal balance of specialization and agility

**🦁🦁🦁🦁 Full Pack** (4 people) ⭐ **IDEAL**

- Role 1: Requirements Hunter
- Role 2: Specification Refiner
- Role 3: Implementation Expert
- Role 4: QA & Testing Specialist
- Maximum specialization and throughput

### Detailed Hunt Cycle Steps

#### Phase 0: Hunt Initiation 🚀

**Trigger:** New feature request or task

```bash
# Team Lead creates initial issue
lionpack hunt start "Implement user authentication"

# System automatically:
# 1. Creates issue with pack-hunt label
# 2. Assigns to Requirements Hunter
# 3. Sets status to "Requirements"
# 4. Creates pack hunt cycle tracker
```

**Output:**

- GitHub issue created
- Assigned to Role 1: Requirements Hunter
- Issue status: "Awaiting Requirements"
- Pack Hunt cycle #N started

---

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis 🔍 (Role 1)

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours typical

**Requirements Hunter does:**

1. Analyze the feature request
2. Define:

   - What is the problem?
   - Who are the users?
   - What's the success criteria?
   - What are constraints?
   - What edge cases exist?

3. Create requirements document:

   ```markdown
   ## Requirements

   ### User Story

   As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

   ### Success Criteria

   - [ ] Can create account with email
   - [ ] Password validation enforced
   - [ ] Confirmation email sent

   ### Constraints

   - Must comply with GDPR
   - Max 3 login attempts

   ### Edge Cases

   - Duplicate email handling
   - Confirmation email retry
   - Password reset flow
   ```

4. Comment on issue:

   ```
   ✅ Requirements Complete

   **Problem:** Users need secure account creation
   **Users:** New platform users
   **Success:** 1000 accounts created in first month
   **Constraints:** GDPR, rate limiting, email validation
   ```

5. Assign to Role 2 and move to "Spec Refinement"

**AI Helper (Requirements Analyzer):**

- Suggests edge cases
- Identifies missing requirements
- Proposes success metrics
- Highlights compliance concerns

---

#### Phase 2: Specification Refinement 📋 (Role 2)

**Timeline:** 4-8 hours typical

**Specification Refiner does:**

1. Read and validate requirements
2. Design solution architecture
3. Break into implementation tasks (typically 3-5 issues)
4. Create spec document:

   ```markdown
   # Authentication System Specification

   ## Architecture

   [Diagram of flow]

   ## API Endpoints

   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - POST /api/auth/logout

   ## Database Schema

   - users table (email, password_hash, created_at)

   ## Implementation Tasks

   1. Backend: Create user model and validation
   2. Backend: Create auth endpoints
   3. Frontend: Create login form
   4. Frontend: Handle auth state
   5. Testing: E2E auth flow tests
   ```

5. Create implementation issues:

   ```
   Issue #101: Backend - Create user model
   Issue #102: Backend - Implement auth endpoints
   Issue #103: Frontend - Login form component
   Issue #104: Frontend - Auth state management
   Issue #105: Testing - E2E authentication tests
   ```

6. Link all to parent epic/issue
7. Tag with `spec-approved`, `ready-to-implement`
8. Assign implementation issues to Role 3

**AI Helper (Specification Master):**

- Suggests task breakdown
- Estimates complexity/story points
- Identifies dependencies
- Generates implementation checklists

---

#### Phase 3: Implementation 🎯 (Role 3)

**Timeline:** 1-3 days per task

**Implementation Hunter does (for each task):**

1. Pick an issue from `ready-to-implement`
2. Implement based on spec and acceptance criteria
3. Write tests for implementation
4. Create commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user registration endpoint (#102)"
   ```
5. Open PR with checklist:

   ```markdown
   ## Changes

   - Implemented user registration endpoint
   - Added email validation
   - Added password hashing

   ## Testing

   - [x] Unit tests (95% coverage)
   - [x] Integration tests
   - [x] Manual testing

   ## Acceptance Criteria

- Identifies best practices
- Detects potential issues

---

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ✅ (Role 4)

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours per task

   - [x] Password validation enforced
   - [x] Confirmation email sent
   - [x] Handles duplicate emails
   - [x] No SQL injection possible
   - [x] Follows GDPR requirements
   ```

3. Manual testing on test environment
4. Code review for quality
5. Verify test coverage >= 80%
6. Approve or request changes

7. **If Approved:**
   ```bash
   # Merge PR (auto-closes issue)
   # System records metrics:
   - Task completed ✅
   - Time from start to finish
   - Team members involved
   - Quality score
   ```

**AI Helper (QA Expert):**

- Suggests test scenarios
- Identifies edge cases missed
- Reviews code quality
- Checks compliance

### Pack Hunt Parallelization

While Role 1 (Requirements) analyzes Feature A, Roles 2-4 can continue working on Feature B's hunt cycle!

```
Timeline:

Week 1:
├─ Feature A: Role 1 (Requirements) ▓░░░░░░░░░░░░
├─ Feature B: Role 2 (Specs) ▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
├─ Feature C: Role 3 (Impl) ▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
└─ Feature D: Role 4 (Testing) ▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Week 2:
├─ Feature A: Role 2 (Specs) ░▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
├─ Feature B: Role 3 (Impl) ░▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
├─ Feature C: Role 4 (Testing) ░▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
└─ Feature E: Role 1 (Requirements) ░▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░
```

**Result:** Maximum team utilization, no role bottlenecks!

## Migration Guide

### For Existing LEO Users

**Option 1: Fresh LionPack Install** (Recommended for teams)

```bash
npm uninstall -g leo-workflow-kit
npm install -g @osp-group/lionpack

lionpack team init
```

**Option 2: Migrate Existing Project**

```bash
# Convert existing LEO setup to LionPack
lionpack migrate ./your-project

# System will:
# - Keep existing issues and templates
# - Add team role system
# - Set up hunt cycle tracking
# - Maintain GitHub Projects integration
```

**Option 3: Keep LEO + Add LionPack** (Hybrid)

```bash
# Install both
npm install -g leo-workflow-kit @osp-group/lionpack

# Use LEO for solo projects
leo init

# Use LionPack for team projects
lionpack team init
```

## Questions for Leo?

1. Does the pack hunting metaphor feel right for your vision?
2. Should we support custom role definitions beyond the 4 core roles?
3. Should LionPack be a separate package or a LEO v5.0 major upgrade?
4. Are there specific automation workflows most important to you?
5. Should we create a web dashboard for team analytics?
