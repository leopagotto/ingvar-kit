---## ü§ñ About Cline

Cline is a VSCode extension powered by Claude AI that provides autonomous coding assistance:
- **File Operations**: Creates, edits, and refactors files
- **Terminal Access**: Executes commands and tests
- **Context Awareness**: Understands entire codebase
- **Autonomous Tasks**: Completes multi-step features independently

## üéØ Cline-Specific Workflow

### Using Cline Effectively

**Task Delegation:**
- Provide clear, actionable tasks: "Create a login component with email/password fields"
- Break complex features into smaller tasks
- Let Cline handle multi-file changes autonomously
- Review Cline's proposed changes before accepting

**File Operations:**
- Cline can create multiple files in one task
- Reference files explicitly: "Update auth.js and add tests in auth.test.js"
- Cline respects existing file structure
- Review diffs carefully before applying

**Terminal Commands:**
- Cline can run npm install, git commands, tests
- Always review commands before execution
- Check terminal output for errors
- Cline can fix errors autonomously if prompted

**Context Management:**
- Cline reads entire project structure
- Reference related files: "Look at user-service.js for patterns"
- Cline maintains context across multi-step tasks
- Use @filename to focus on specific files

## üí° Claude's Strengths (via Cline)

### What Claude Does Best

1. **Autonomous Task Completion**
   - Give high-level goals, Claude breaks them down
   - Handles multi-file refactoring
   - Creates tests alongside features

2. **Code Understanding**
   - Deep analysis of complex codebases
   - Explains technical debt and suggests improvements
   - Identifies patterns and anti-patterns

3. **Refactoring at Scale**
   - Safe refactoring across multiple files
   - Maintains functionality while improving structure
   - Suggests architectural improvements

4. **Error Resolution**
   - Analyzes error messages and stack traces
   - Proposes and implements fixes
   - Adds defensive error handling

### Best Practices with Cline

- **Start Broad**: "Implement OAuth2 authentication with Google"
- **Add Details**: "Use passport.js, store tokens in PostgreSQL"
- **Review Diffs**: Check all file changes before accepting
- **Iterate**: Give feedback and let Cline refine
- **Trust Autonomy**: Let Cline handle repetitive tasks (file creation, testing)

## üöÄ Cline Workflow Tips

### Effective Prompts

‚úÖ **Good Prompts:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user registration with validation"
- "Refactor the authentication logic to use async/await"
- "Add unit tests for the payment service"
- "Fix the responsive layout issues on mobile"

‚ùå **Vague Prompts:**
- "Make it better"
- "Fix stuff"
- "Improve code"

### Task Execution

1. **Planning Phase**: Cline outlines approach
2. **File Changes**: Proposes edits with diffs
3. **Terminal Commands**: Suggests commands to run
4. **Review**: You approve or request changes
5. **Execution**: Cline applies changes autonomously

### Error Handling

- Cline reads terminal output and error messages
- Can fix errors autonomously if given permission
- Review error fixes before accepting
- Cline learns from past errors in the session

## üìã Integration with LEO workflow

### Issue Creation
When Cline completes a task, ensure:
- GitHub issue is created/updated automatically
- Commits reference issue numbers
- PR links back to issue

### Status Updates
Cline can update issue status:
- "Mark issue #42 as In Progress"
- "Close issue #42 after this fix"
- Automatically move to Done when merged

### Testing
Always ask Cline to:
- Write tests for new features
- Run tests after changes
- Fix failing tests
