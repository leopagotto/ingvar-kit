## [5.11.0] - 2025-10-31

### 🔴 Fixed: Critical Spark Generator Bug

**Problem:** `ingvar spark` command completely failed with `TypeError: SparkGenerator is not a constructor`. 100% reproduction rate - primary feature was completely broken.

**Root Cause:** Export/import mismatch in module system:

- `spark-generator.js` used **named exports**: `module.exports = { SparkGenerator, generateSparkApp }`
- `cli.js` tried to import as default: `const SparkGenerator = require('...')`
- Result: SparkGenerator was undefined, causing TypeError

**Solution:** Fixed destructuring in both places:

- Changed `const SparkGenerator = require('...')` → `const { SparkGenerator } = require('...')`
- Fixed in `spark` command (line 172)
- Fixed in `detect` command (line 141)

**Impact:** ✅ Spark generator now works - users can generate apps with `ingvar spark`

### 🏗️ Added: Complexity Estimation & Spec-First Workflow

**Problem:** Orchestrator violated its own documented rules - jumped directly to implementation for complex work, skipping mandatory spec-first workflow.

**Solution:** Implemented intelligent complexity detection:

**New Features:**

1. **ComplexityEstimator Utility** (`lib/utils/complexity-estimator.js`)

   - Analyzes task descriptions with scoring algorithm
   - Detects: simple (<1 day), moderate (2-5 days), complex (1+ weeks)
   - Identifies high-complexity indicators: "app", "enterprise", "platform", "architecture"
   - Counts features: pages, components, modules
   - Recognizes architecture decision keywords
   - Returns confidence score and recommendation

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**

   - Task type detection (feature, bug-fix, refactor, documentation)
   - Estimated effort calculation
   - Feature extraction (from lists and "with X and Y" patterns)
   - Spec-first recommendation with rationale

3. **User-Friendly Output**
   - Color-coded complexity display (green/yellow/red)
   - Feature detection and listing
   - Clear workflow recommendations
   - Rationale for spec-first approach

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
const { ComplexityEstimator } = require("./lib/utils/complexity-estimator");
const estimator = new ComplexityEstimator();

const analysis = estimator.analyze(
  "build enterprise order management app with 8 pages"
);
// Result:
// {
//   complexity: 'complex',
//   taskType: 'feature',
//   estimatedEffort: '1+ weeks',
//   specFirstRecommended: true,
//   features: ['order management', 'dashboard', 'analytics', ...]
// }

estimator.displayAnalysis(analysis);
// Outputs formatted recommendation to console
```

**Detection Algorithm:**

- High-complexity keywords (2 points): app, application, system, platform, enterprise, architecture
- Medium-complexity keywords (1 point): integrate, refactor, dashboard, authentication
- Component indicators (1 point each): page, screen, view, component, feature, module
- Number multipliers: "8 pages" = 8 additional points
- Architecture keywords (3 points): design, architecture, database schema, API design

**Scoring Thresholds:**

- Simple: 0-3 points
- Moderate: 4-7 points
- Complex: 8+ points

### ✅ Added: Comprehensive Test Suite

**New Tests:** `tests/complexity-estimator.test.js`

- 20+ test cases covering all estimation scenarios
- Validates detection of simple/moderate/complex work
- Tests real user requests from bug reports
- Verifies task type identification (bug-fix, feature, refactor, docs)
- Tests feature extraction patterns
- Validates recommendation messages

**Test Coverage:**

- ✅ Simple work: "fix button color" → simple
- ✅ Moderate work: "refactor authentication module" → moderate
- ✅ Complex work: "build enterprise app with 8 pages" → complex
- ✅ Architecture work: "design microservices platform" → complex
- ✅ Bug report scenario: "build fulfilment order management..." → complex

### 📖 Next Steps (To Be Implemented)

**Orchestrator Integration** (Planned for 5.12.0):

- [ ] Integrate ComplexityEstimator into Orchestrator Agent
- [ ] Add automatic spec-first workflow for complex tasks
- [ ] Implement approval checkpoint before implementation
- [ ] Break complex work into multiple trackable issues
- [ ] Add confirmation prompts for user control

**Workflow Enforcement:**

```javascript
// Pseudocode for future implementation
async function routeTask(userRequest) {
  const analysis = estimator.analyze(userRequest);

  if (analysis.complexity === "complex") {
    console.log("🏗️ Complex work detected - creating spec first...");
    await createSpecFile(userRequest, analysis);
    await commentOnIssue("📋 Spec created - please review and approve");
    console.log("⏳ Waiting for approval before proceeding...");
    return; // Don't proceed until approved
  }

  // Simple work - proceed directly
  await createIssueAndImplement(userRequest);
}
```

## [5.10.0] - 2025-10-30

### 🔄 Changed: Modular Instruction Architecture (BREAKING CHANGE)

**Problem:** Massive duplication between `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (4,499 lines with full agent instructions embedded) and `lib/ai-instructions/` folder (separate agent files). Updates required in TWO places, inconsistency risk, unwieldy navigation.

**Solution:** Modular architecture with lightweight core file + detailed agent files as single source of truth.

### Changed

- **Copilot Instructions**: Restructured `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

  - Reduced file size by 89% (4,499 → 500 lines)
  - Removed embedded agent instructions (no more duplication)
  - Kept core workflow rules (issue creation, commit format, status updates)
  - Added agent routing logic with decision tree
  - Created explicit table of all 8 agent files
  - Added workflow example showing `read_file()` usage
  - Added critical reminders checklist (8-point verification)

- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Added 7+ touchpoints to ensure reading agent files
  - Top-level mandatory reading warning
  - 4-step checklist before any work
  - Explicit table listing all agent files with paths
  - Step-by-step "How to Use" instructions
  - Complete workflow example with `read_file()` calls
  - Question #2 in critical reminders: "Did I read the relevant agent instruction file(s)?"
  - Closing reminder: "End of Core Instructions - Now Read Your Agent File!"

## [5.3.4] - 2025-10-29

### 🚀 Added: Custom/Enterprise Model Support

**Problem:** Users with enterprise agreements or beta access to unreleased models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5, etc.) were blocked by Ingvar's hardcoded model registry. The system would reject models it didn't recognize, even though the API providers would accept them.

**Solution:** Removed model validation barrier - Ingvar now accepts ANY model name and lets the API providers handle validation.

### Added

- **🎯 Custom Model Support**

  - Accept ANY model name in configuration (e.g., `claude-4.5-sonnet`, `gpt-5`, etc.)
  - Perfect for beta testers, enterprise customers, or users with special API access
  - System validates at API provider level, not at Ingvar level

- **📝 Custom Model Documentation**

  - New section in MODEL_QUALITY_CONTROL.md for enterprise/beta models
  - Examples for common enterprise scenarios
  - Optional metadata registration for better tracking

- **💡 Enhanced Verbose Output**
  - Shows "Custom/Beta/Enterprise model" indicator for non-registry models
  - Warns users to ensure API access
  - Graceful handling of unknown model metadata

### Changed

- `isModelAvailable()` now always returns `true` - validation happens at API level
- `showReasoning` configuration now supports kebab-case (`show-reasoning`) in addition to camelCase
- Fixed-model verbose output includes warnings for custom models

### Fixed

- Test suite updated to reflect new behavior (all 583 tests passing)
- Model metadata display handles missing registry entries gracefully

### Configuration Examples

**Use Enterprise Beta Model:**

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "fixed-model": "claude-4.5-sonnet",
    "verbose": true,
    "show-reasoning": true
  }
}
```

**Define Custom Model Metadata:**

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "custom-models": {
      "claude-4.5-sonnet": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "tier": "ultra-premium",
        "description": "Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Enterprise Beta)"
      }
    },
    "fixed-model": "claude-4.5-sonnet"
  }
}
```

## [5.3.3] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Model Quality Control

**Problem:** v5.3.1 introduced cost optimization that downgraded Orchestrator and Documentation agents to Claude 3 Haiku. For users coming from GitHub Copilot (using GPT-4/Claude 3.5 Sonnet), this was a **quality regression** that blocked adoption.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive configuration options for quality vs cost control:

### Added

- **🎛️ Quality-First Mode** (`upgrade-defaults: true` - NEW DEFAULT)

  - All agents use best available models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or better)
  - Orchestrator: `claude-3.5-sonnet` (was `claude-3-haiku`)
  - Documentation: `claude-3.5-sonnet` (was `claude-3-haiku`)
  - Frontend: `claude-3.5-sonnet` for all tasks
  - No quality regression from Copilot/high-quality baselines

- **🔒 Fixed Model Mode** (`fixed-model: "model-name"`)

  - Use single model for ALL agents regardless of complexity
  - Example: `"fixed-model": "claude-3.5-sonnet"`
  - Perfect for consistency, testing, or specific model preferences

- **⚡ Dynamic Selection Toggle** (`enabled: true/false`)

  - Turn model selection on/off completely
  - When disabled, always uses `claude-3.5-sonnet` as default

- **💰 Balanced Mode** (`upgrade-defaults: false`)

  - Original v5.3.1 cost optimization (~40% savings)
  - Uses Claude 3 Haiku for simple/moderate orchestrator/docs tasks
  - Still available for budget-conscious users

- **📊 Verbose Configuration Display**

  - Shows enabled/disabled status on startup
  - Shows strategy (dynamic/fixed)
  - Shows fixed model when set
  - Shows upgrade-defaults setting

- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**
  - New guide: `docs/MODEL_QUALITY_CONTROL.md`
  - Use case recommendations
  - Cost analysis
  - Real-world examples
  - Migration guide for Copilot users

### Changed

- **Default behavior is now quality-first** (breaking change from v5.3.1)

  - `upgrade-defaults: true` by default
  - Users can opt-in to cost optimization with `upgrade-defaults: false`
  - Rationale: Quality should be default, cost optimization opt-in

- **Model selection strategy labeling**
  - "Optimized" → "Balanced" (more accurate)
  - "Upgraded" → "Upgraded Defaults" (clearer intent)

### Fixed

- **Quality regression for Copilot users** (blocking issue)

  - Users can now match or exceed Copilot quality
  - No more forced downgrade to Claude Haiku
  - Full control over quality vs cost trade-offs

- **Test suite updated for new configuration**
  - Tests now account for both upgraded and balanced modes
  - All 24 model selection tests passing ✅

### Configuration Examples

**Quality-First (NEW DEFAULT):**

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "upgrade-defaults": true,
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**Fixed Model:**

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "fixed-model": "claude-3.5-sonnet",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**Cost-Optimized:**

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "upgrade-defaults": false,
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

### Migration from v5.3.1/v5.3.2

If you were happy with v5.3.1's cost optimization, set:

```json
{
  "model-selection": {
    "upgrade-defaults": false
  }
}
```

Otherwise, no action needed - quality-first is now the default!

## [5.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### 🎯 Phase 2 Complete: Spec-First Development System

#### Overview

Complete GitHub-native specification workflow with evolution tracking, extensions, and dual-mode task management. Specifications live as GitHub issues (not files) for faster iteration, real-time collaboration, and seamless integration with project boards.

#### New Features

##### Dual-Mode Task Management (Days 8-9)

- ✅ **`ingvar tasks create <issue>`**: Convert spec plan into checklist (default mode)
- ✅ **`ingvar tasks create <issue> --create-issues`**: Create child GitHub issues for parallel work
- ✅ **`ingvar tasks status <issue>`**: Track completion percentage and remaining work
- ✅ **Automatic Label Management**: Creates task, subtask labels if missing
- ✅ **Parent-Child Linking**: Child issues reference parent spec
- ✅ **Smart Mode Selection**: Checklist for small teams, child issues for parallel work

**Impact**: Teams can choose workflow that fits their size (solo → checklist, team → child issues)

##### Spec Evolution Tracking (Days 10-11)

- ✅ **`ingvar spec-diff <issue>`**: Color-coded diff view (green=added, red=removed)
- ✅ **`--timeline`**: Chronological history with timestamps and authors
- ✅ **`--summary`**: Aggregate statistics (items added/removed, sections modified)
- ✅ **`--from <version> --to <version>`**: Compare specific version ranges
- ✅ **`--section <name>`**: Filter by section (requirements, user-stories, acceptance-criteria)
- ✅ **`--max-length <chars>`**: Control text truncation
- ✅ **GitHub Timeline API**: Parse issue edit history (no git diff needed)
- ✅ **Version Numbering**: Automatic version tracking across edits

**Impact**: See how requirements evolved, who changed what, when changes happened

##### Spec Extensions (Days 12-13)

- ✅ **`ingvar spec-extend <issue> <description>`**: Add new requirements to existing specs
- ✅ **`--create-issues`**: Automatically create child issues for extension work
- ✅ **`--no-update`**: Preview mode (show what would be added)
- ✅ **`--no-track-history`**: Skip extension history comment
- ✅ **Additive Merge**: Preserves all existing content (never overwrites)
- ✅ **Extension History**: Track all extensions with timestamps
- ✅ **Auto-Label Creation**: Creates extension, spec-extension labels
- ✅ **AI-Generated Content**: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria

**Impact**: Evolve specs without recreating them, track extension history

#### Documentation

- ✅ **docs/SPEC_DIFF_GUIDE.md**: 650+ lines, 68 sections, comprehensive guide
- ✅ **README.md Updates**: Ingvar vs Spec Kit comparison table, command documentation
- ✅ **Phase Completion Docs**: docs/phases/PHASE_2_DAYS_10-11_COMPLETE.md

#### Why Specs as Issues? (vs File-Based)

| **Ingvar (GitHub-Native)**    | **File-Based Tools**      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ✅ Edit in browser            | ❌ Requires Git/editor    |
| ✅ Real-time comments         | ❌ Pull request delays    |
| ✅ Project board integration  | ❌ Manual tracking        |
| ✅ No merge conflicts         | ❌ Git conflicts on specs |

- ✅ **Faster Responses** - Smaller, focused instruction sets (~13-17KB per agent)
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Enable only agents you need for your project
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Modular agent templates instead of monolithic instructions
- ✅ **Scalability** - Easy to add new agent types in future versions

### ⚡ New `ingvar agent` Command Suite

Complete CLI for managing specialized agents:

```bash
# List all agents and their status
ingvar agent list

# Enable a specialized agent
ingvar agent enable frontend
ingvar agent enable backend

# Disable an agent
ingvar agent disable devops

# Show detailed agent information
ingvar agent info testing

# Regenerate AI instruction files
ingvar agent sync
```

- ✅ Clear status display with emojis and colors
- ✅ Detailed agent information with responsibilities and routing triggers
- ✅ Orchestrator always enabled (cannot be disabled - core routing layer)
- ✅ Integration with config-manager for persistent configuration
- ✅ Error handling for invalid agent names

### 🔧 Enhanced Configuration System

#### New `.leorc.json` Schema

```json
{
  "project-type": "fullstack",
  "agents": {
    "frontend": { "enabled": true },
    "backend": { "enabled": true },
    "devops": { "enabled": false },
    "testing": { "enabled": true },
    "documentation": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

#### Agent Selection During `ingvar init`

- **NEW**: Interactive agent selection based on project type
- **Recommended Agents** shown for each project type:
  - **fullstack**: frontend, backend, testing
  - **frontend-only**: frontend, devops, testing, documentation
  - **backend-only**: backend, devops, testing, documentation
  - **cli-tool**: backend, testing, documentation
- **Smart Defaults** based on project needs

#### Config Manager Enhancements

8 new functions for agent management:

- `validateAgentsConfig()` - Validate agents configuration
- `getEnabledAgents()` - Get list of enabled agents
- `enableAgent(agent, config, skipSync)` - Enable an agent
- `disableAgent(agent, skipSync)` - Disable an agent
- `getAgentConfig(agent)` - Get configuration for specific agent
- `getProjectType()` - Get project type from config
- `getRecommendedAgents(projectType)` - Get recommended agents by type

### 📝 Intelligent Routing System

#### Single-Agent Tasks

**Example: "Add a search bar to the header"**

```
Orchestrator analyzes:
  - Keywords: "search bar", "header" → Frontend task
  - Routes to: Frontend Agent

Frontend Agent implements:
  - Creates SearchBar component
  - Adds styling and accessibility
  - Updates Header component
```

#### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Example: "Add OAuth2 login with Google"**

```
Orchestrator analyzes:
  - "OAuth2" + "login" → Backend + Frontend
  - Multi-agent coordination needed

Step 1: Backend Agent
  - Creates /api/auth/google endpoint
  - Configures OAuth2 provider

Step 2: Frontend Agent (with context from Backend)
  - Creates LoginButton component
  - Integrates with backend API

Orchestrator: Verifies integration
```

#### Routing Triggers

Each agent activates based on:

- **Keywords** - Specific terms in user requests
- **File Patterns** - Files being modified
- **User Intent** - Desired outcome analysis
