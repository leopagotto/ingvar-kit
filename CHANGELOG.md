## [6.0.0] - 2025-10-31

### 🎯 Major: Modular AI Instructions Architecture

**Breaking Changes:** None for users, but AI instruction generation completely refactored.

#### 1. 🎨 Copilot Instructions Refactor (90.7% Size Reduction)

**Problem:**
- \`.github/copilot-instructions.md\` was 4,967 lines with ALL agent instructions embedded
- Massive duplication of standards and patterns
- Designer Agent existed but wasn't integrated
- Hard to maintain (changes required updating 3 places)

**Solution:**
- Reduced copilot instructions from 4,967 → 464 lines (90.7% reduction!)
- Now references modular agent files in \`lib/ai-instructions/\`
- Added Designer Agent to builder system
- Single source of truth per agent

**Architecture:**

\`\`\`
Before: Monolithic (4,967 lines)
.github/copilot-instructions.md
└── ALL agent instructions embedded

After: Modular (464 lines)
.github/copilot-instructions.md (core rules + routing)
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/orchestrator-main.md
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/designer-agent.md ✨ NEW
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/frontend-agent.md
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/backend-agent.md
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/devops-agent.md
├── References: lib/ai-instructions/testing-agent.md
└── References: lib/ai-instructions/documentation-agent.md
\`\`\`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 90.7% smaller main instructions file
- ✅ Zero duplication (DRY principle)
- ✅ Designer Agent now fully integrated
- ✅ Update once, applies everywhere
- ✅ Faster for AI to read and understand

#### 2. 🔧 Component Installation Accuracy (Issue #1)

**Problem:**
- Installation claimed "72 components installed" when only 26 succeeded
- Generated \`index.ts\` exported 46 missing components (caused TypeScript errors)
- No validation of actual installation success
- Silent failures for IKEA registry authentication issues

**Solution:**
- Track \`installedComponents\` vs \`failedComponents\` separately
- Only export components that actually exist
- Accurate reporting: "26 installed, 46 failed (registry auth required)"
- Clear warnings about IKEA internal registry requirements

**Example Output:**

\`\`\`bash
✨ Component installation complete!

📊 Installation Summary:
  ✅ Successfully installed: 26 components (local templates)
  ⚠️  Failed (registry auth required): 46 components
  📁 Components installed to: src/components/ingka/

⚠️  Note: Some components require IKEA internal registry access.
   External users receive local templates only.
\`\`\`

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more TypeScript errors from missing imports
- ✅ Transparent about what's available vs requires auth
- ✅ Generated README shows component status
- ✅ Removed broken \`@ingka/design-tokens\` exports

### 🎨 Designer Agent Integration

**Added:** Designer Agent now fully integrated into multi-agent system

- ✅ Imported in \`lib/ai-instructions/builder.js\`
- ✅ Registered in \`getAgentGenerators()\`
- ✅ Available in copilot instructions
- ✅ Designer-first workflow now functional

**Designer-First Workflow:**

\`\`\`
User Request: "Build a login page"
    ↓
Orchestrator: Detects UI/UX work
    ↓
Designer: Creates rapid HTML/CSS mockup (30 min)
    ↓
User: Reviews and approves
    ↓
Frontend: Implements from Designer specs
    ↓
Testing: Writes tests
    ↓
Done! ✅
\`\`\`

### 📚 Documentation

**Added:**
- \`docs/development/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_REFACTOR_V6.md\` - Complete refactor documentation
- Updated component installation README with accurate status

**Changed:**
- \`.github/copilot-instructions.md\` - Now 464 lines (references modular files)
- \`lib/ai-instructions/builder.js\` - Added Designer agent support

**Preserved:**
- \`.github/copilot-instructions.md.backup\` - Original 4,967-line version saved

### 🔄 Migration Notes

**For Users:**
- ✅ No breaking changes - everything works the same
- ✅ Designer Agent now available (bonus feature!)
- ✅ Component installation more transparent

**For Developers:**
- ✅ Update agent logic in ONE place: \`lib/agents/*-template.js\`
- ✅ Changes automatically apply to all AI assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Codeium)
- ❌ DON'T update \`.github/copilot-instructions.md\` directly (it references files!)

### 📊 Statistics

- **Copilot Instructions:** 4,967 → 464 lines (90.7% reduction)
- **Agents Available:** 6 → 7 (Designer added)
- **Installation Accuracy:** ~100% false → 100% accurate
- **Component Export Errors:** 46 broken imports → 0 broken imports

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed: Copilot instructions missing Designer Agent
- Fixed: Component installation reporting inaccurate metrics (#1)
- Fixed: Broken TypeScript imports for missing @ingka components
- Fixed: Silent failures for registry authentication issues

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- 46 IKEA components require internal registry access (documented)
- External users get 26 local templates (working as intended)
- Design foundation components (design-tokens, colours, typography) require IKEA auth

## [5.13.0] - 2025-10-31

### 🚀 Performance: CLI Startup Optimization (20x Faster)

**Problem:** CLI had severe startup performance issues - taking 1.2+ seconds just to display version or help.

**Solution:** Implemented lazy loading - commands load on-demand instead of at startup.

**Results:** 1.2s → 0.06s (20x faster, 95% reduction)

**Impact:**
- Every CLI command now starts instantly
- Reduced module loading overhead
- Better developer experience
